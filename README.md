# Factual Consistency in Summarization 


## SummEdits Benchmark (Section 6-7)

We release the data for the 10 domains in the SummEdits benchmark in the [data/summedits](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/tree/master/data/summedits) folder.

The [SummEdits_Benchmark.ipynb](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/SummEdits_Benchmark.ipynb) notebook provides information on how to access open, and visualize the dataset.

## FactCC Explanation Analysis (Section 3.5)

As part of the paper, we annotated 3.6k explanations generated by models justifying their choice to identify a summary as *inconsistent*. The annotations are available in [data/factcc/factcc_explanation_annotation.json](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/data/factcc/factcc_explanation_annotation.json).
The notebook [FactCC_Explanation_Annotation.ipynb](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/FactCC_Explanation_Annotation.ipynb) shows how to load/view the annotations.
