# Factual Consistency in Summarization 


## SummEdits Benchmark (Section 6-7)

We release the data for the 10 domains in the SummEdits benchmark in the [data/summedits](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/tree/master/data/summedits) folder.

The [SummEdits_Benchmark.ipynb](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/SummEdits_Benchmark.ipynb) notebook provides information on how to access open, and visualize the dataset.

## FactCC Explanation Analysis (Section 3.5)

As part of the paper, we annotated 3.6k explanations generated by models justifying their choice to identify a summary as *inconsistent*. The annotations are available in [data/factcc/factcc_explanation_annotation.json](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/data/factcc/factcc_explanation_annotation.json).
The notebook [FactCC_Explanation_Annotation.ipynb](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/FactCC_Explanation_Annotation.ipynb) shows how to load/view the annotations.

## Prompts

We release all prompts that were used in experiments in the paper in the [prompts/](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/tree/master/prompts/) folder. More specifically:
- [summedits/factcc](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/prompts/factcc/) is a folder that contains the 26 prompts that we experimented with in initial FactCC experiments (Section 3.1)
- [summedits/step2_consistent.txt](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/prompts/summedits/step2_consistent.txt) and [summedits/step2_inconsistent.txt](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/prompts/summedits/step2_inconsistent.txt) were the prompts used in Step 2 of the SummEdits protocol to generate edits of seed summaries. (Section 5.2)
- [summedits/standard_zs_prompt.txt](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/prompts/summedits/standard_zs_prompt.txt) is the zero-shot prompt that was used to assess all LLM model performance on the SummEdits benchmark. (Section 6.3)
- [summedits/edit_typing_gpt4.txt](https://github.com/salesforce/factualNLG/blob/master/prompts/summedits/edit_typing_gpt4.txt) is a few-shot prompt used to predict the types of edits for inconsistent samples in SummEdits (Section 6.4)
