Government officials say they were killed by a left-wing guerrilla group, the Paraguayan People's Army. Their bodies are due to be repatriated to Germany as an investigation into the killings continues. The couple had been held along with four ranch workers on their farm outside Yby Yau, around 395km  (245 miles) from Paraguay's capital, Asuncion. The workers had escaped but both Germans were killed. A government investigator said police had found the bodies after a shoot-out with fighters they allege belonged to the guerrilla group. The investigators said the guerrillas had been demanding money and food from local ranchers to be given to the poor as compensation for alleged deforestation. The Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) is estimated to number between 50 and 150 people. It has been blamed for a series of killings in the last few years. In May 2013 it was accused of killing Luis Lindstron, a former city mayor and owner of a logging operation. Various political leaders have tried to eliminate the EPP. In 2010, Fernando Lugo, who was president at the time, declared a state of emergency and sent 200 crack troops to find the rebels. In 2011 the government tried again, this time sending about 3,000 troops and police. Some arrests were made, but the group remained elusive. Correspondents say the EPP appears to be changing its strategy, focussing less on kidnappings and more on attacking ranches and trying to extract payments from landowners.

It comes after 47-year-old Mrs Akoun suffered a miscarriage following accidentally falling pregnant not long after meeting her husband. After several more miscarriages, the couple assessed other options, including surrogacy. But after creating a profile on a surrogacy website they were duped out of \u00a3400 by a woman who conned them into starting the procedure. Undeterred, Mr and Mrs Akoun joined a Facebook group, through which they found two women, with partners and children of their own. Mother-of-five Tricia Hunt, 36, and Kate Fruin-Smith, 37, who also has five of her own children, were paid a monthly fee by the couple after becoming pregnant. Mrs Akoun, an assistant manager in a care home, said they were \"ecstatic\" after the couple were able to have the \"twins\" they never had. Their daughters, Nyobi and Kenya were born within a month of each other in June and July last year. Mrs Akoun, who has an 18-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, said they keep in touch with the surrogate mothers. \"The relationship is like family and we're still in touch. I don't have any jealousy or insecurity when they're here,\" she said. \"To both girls, I am their mum.\" Mrs Hunt and Ms Fruin-Smith, who live in different parts of the UK, both decided to become surrogate mothers as a way of \"giving back\". The women had used donor sperm to become pregnant in their separate same-sex relationships and felt they could help other women trying to start a family.

Athletics' governing body says Russia has made \"considerable progress\" but there is \"significant work to be done\". Russia will find out in May if it can send athletes to the Olympic Games. Mutko told Reuters: \"You say we should elect new leadership for the athletics federation - OK, we've done that. \"You should not elect anyone to be the leader who has done this or that - OK, we did that. \"There are no criteria. What should Russian athletics do? Dance on the table? Sing a song?\" Media playback is not supported on this device Mutko's comments came after a taskforce set up by the International Association of Athletics Federations revealed its findings at a meeting in Monaco on Friday. Russia's athletics federation was suspended by the sport's world governing body in November after being accused of \"state-sponsored\" doping. IAAF president Lord Coe revealed five other nations - Ethiopia, Morocco, Ukraine, Kenya and Belarus - are also under scrutiny. He told BBC Sport: \"We want to return trust to our sport, this is not just a Russian issue. We have to be on the front foot, we need to be proactive about these things. \"I'm here to be judged on how many athletes I can get from safe secure systems into free, fair and open competition. And that has to be the sole arbiter.\" On the five other nations that are having their doping systems closely monitored, he said: \"Ethiopia and Morocco, as a matter of urgency, both need to implement adequate and robust testing in and out of competition. \"Kenya, Ukraine and Belarus have been put on a monitoring list for 2016 to strengthen their anti-doping regimes and make sure their journey to compliance is completed by the end of the year. \"There are no immediate sanctions. It is just a wake-up call. Sanctions will only be considered if they don't comply with requirements.\" The double Olympic champion also confirmed that a final decision on whether a Russian athletics team would compete in Rio would be made at the next IAAF council meeting, which will be convened for that specific purpose in May. Russia was suspended following the publication of an independent World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) report that examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in its athletics. It must demonstrate it meets Wada and IAAF rules before being readmitted into the sport and, potentially, allowed to compete in the Rio Olympics. The suspended Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) must also be able to operate without interference, following claims the country's security services were involved in the doping programme. Rune Andersen, a former director of Wada, leads the five-strong IAAF taskforce which is examining Russia's anti-doping procedures. \"Russian authorities have made significant progress to meeting many of the verification criteria established by the IAAF, including changing president and council,\" Andersen said. \"The view of the taskforce is there is significant work still to be done to satisfy the reinstatement conditions - it's a big job and they're just at the beginning of this.\" In an open letter, Beckie Scott, chair of the committee that represents athletes at Wada, wrote: \"There needs to be further investigation into other sports in Russia, and other countries identified in the report. \"The response to date - to such an evidence-based, incriminating report - has been unsatisfactory, and we renew our call for Wada to extend the mandate of the independent commission to sports in Russia other than athletics, as well as other countries named in the report. \"Wada states clearly that it supports clean athletes and at the moment, clean athletes are disappointed with the lack of action that has been taken.\"", "summary": "Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko claims the country has done everything it has been required of it to meet IAAF anti-doping standards since being disqualified May.", "samples": [{"reason_idx": 32, "prediction": 0, "model": "cgpt", "prompt": "fewshot-gwe-prompt2", "annotation": "incorrect", "explanation": "No, the summary is not factually correct.

The researchers studied more than 1,000 patients whose BP readings had been taken by both doctors and nurses at the same visit. Lead researcher Dr Christopher Clark said the study findings suggested doctors might not be best placed to monitor blood pressure. He said: \"Doctors should continue to measure blood pressure as part of the assessment of an ill patient or a routine check-up, but not where clinical decisions on blood pressure treatment depend on the outcome. \"The difference we noted is enough to tip some patients over the threshold for treatment for high blood pressure, and unnecessary medication can lead to unwanted side-effects.\" Blood pressure can fluctuate throughout the day. Having one raised reading does not necessarily mean you have high blood pressure. Feeling anxious or stressed when you visit your GP can raise your blood pressure, the NHS advises. Increasingly, to get more accurate readings, doctors are giving patients portable testing kits that measure blood pressure at home over the course of a day and night. Spotting and treating high blood pressure is important to lower the risk of future complications such as heart attacks and stroke.

Six-month prison sentences and fines of 3,000 euros (\u00c2\u00a32,580; $4,000) are envisaged for clients of prostitutes. Some campaigners reject the bill, advocating prostitutes' rights instead. Around 20,000 people are believed to be working as prostitutes in France. France has been committed to abolishing the practice in principle since 1960. The resolution said the country should seek \"a society without prostitution\" and that sex work \"should in no case be designated as a professional activity\". It urged abolition at a time when \"prostitution seems to be becoming routine in Europe\". In 1999, the Swedish government brought in similar legislation to criminalise the buying of sex, while decriminalising its sale. Under existing French laws on prostitution, summed up by French Roman Catholic newspaper La Croix Guy Geoffroy, an MP from the ruling UMP party who sits on the commission, said France's political parties had reached a consensus on the issue because it was a matter of \"republican ethics\". Nine out of 10 prostitutes were victims of trafficking, he said. \"From now on prostitution is regarded from the point of view of violence against women and that has become unacceptable for everyone,\" Mr Geoffroy added. Yves Charpenel, head of the Fondation Scelles group which fights human trafficking and also advocates criminalisation, said it was unclear whether the bill would eventually be adopted. \"There is no consensus yet on this subject,\" he said, according to AFP news agency. \"Will the deputies who vote for the abolitionist resolution then vote for its concrete application? More than ever, it is necessary to clarify the French position.\" Another advocate of criminalisation, a French-led men's initiative known as ZeroMacho which was inspired by the historian and feminist Florence Montreynaud, has published a manifesto against prostitution, gathering some 200 signatures across EU states. ZeroMacho member Jean-Sebastien Mallet told French women's website Terrafemina that it wanted to speak for \"the vast majority of men - hitherto silent - who do not use prostitutes\". However, France's sex workers' trade union, Strass, called a rally outside parliament to oppose the proposed bill. Several dozen prostitutes and supporters gathered under placards reading \"Sex Work is Work\" and \"Prostitution - No Repression - No Punishment - Rights!\" Punishing clients would \"deprive prostitutes of work that provides them with a living, give clients more power over them and push prostitutes to turn to intermediaries to be able to work\", said Sarah-Marie Maffesoli, a lawyer for Strass. In a letter to MPs, it and other groups accused politicians of treating prostitutes as \"marginals whose voice does not deserve to be heard\". Strass draws a clear distinction between consensual prostitution and sexual trafficking. A man at the demonstration who described himself as a \"client of sex-workers\" said he was \"against enslavement\". \"If I thought that the prostitutes I know were being enslaved, I would no longer be a client,\" he told Reuters news agency.", "summary": "Prostitution - No Repression - No Punishment - Rights has pledged to abolish the practice in principle since 1960.", "samples": [{"reason_idx": 22, "prediction": 0, "model": "dav003", "prompt": "fewshot-cot-prompt2", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "The document states that France has been committed to abolishing the practice in principle since 1960 and that the proposed bill will criminalse the buying of sex, while decriminalising its sale.

The 39-year-old producer was found by two neighbours beaten to death on a hillside outside her holiday home in a remote part of west Cork in 1996. Mr Bailey denies any involvement in the death and was never charged. Under cross-examination in the High Court in Dublin, the 57-year-old was forced to recount his history of violence and a litany of injuries his partner Jules Thomas suffered at his hands. Admitting he had been \"seriously violent\" towards his Welsh-born artist girlfriend three times, Mr Bailey said they separated for several months in mid-1996 after she sought a protection order against him. \"It's common knowledge, to my eternal shame, that in the past when I used to drink spirits, that to my eternal shame, that I was involved in incidents of domestic violence with Ms Thomas,\" Mr Bailey said. \"I don't know what I can say about that other than to say it's to my eternal shame.\" In the most recent beating, in August 2001, the court heard Mr Bailey hit Ms Thomas across the face, body and limbs with a crutch after she woke him from a nap on a sofa in their home near Schull, west Cork. Mr Bailey pleaded guilty to an assault charge and was given a suspended sentence. In an earlier incident, Mr Bailey told the court, he pulled out a 4cm clump of Ms Thomas' hair, left her with a closed black eye, in need of stitches inside her mouth and bruising to the face and head, hands and arms after a row broke out in her car as she drove them home from a west Cork pub. Ms Thomas was kept in hospital in Cork city for one night after the attack and the couple separated and got back together before Christmas. Mr Bailey told the court Ms Thomas grabbed him when they were in her car after a night socialising and drinking. He reacted by pushing her away before attacking her. He was shown four photos of injuries to Ms Thomas but refused to detail them to the jury. Pressed on the injuries by senior counsel for the state, Mr Bailey agreed Ms Thomas was shown with a closed, blackened right eye, bandaged and badly bruised arms. The couple have been side by side since the case started over a week ago. In the earliest violent attack, in 1993, the court heard Mr Bailey attacked Ms Thomas after waking from sleep with a nosebleed and lashing out. Almost 20 years on from the killing of Ms Toscan du Plantier, Mr Bailey, originally from England and resident in County Cork for 23 years, is suing for wrongful arrest and the handling of the murder investigation. The jury of eight men and four women has been told the state denies all claims. Mr Bailey was arrested twice on suspicion of the murder of Ms Toscan du Plantier, first on 10 February 1997 and again on 20 January 1998.

A separate calculation suggests that Christmas trees, too, are getting cheaper, costing just an eighth of what they did back in 1975. One reason for falling prices may be the arrival of low-cost supermarkets. However, the increasing cost of importing food may mean that Christmas 2016 will mark the low point for prices. The Christmas dinner index - compiled by Good Housekeeping magazine - suggests that the 11 ingredients necessary are now 10.8% cheaper than they were in 2009. Buying everything from the turkey to Christmas pudding is likely to cost \u00a32.48 a head this year, if you bought each in the cheapest supermarket. In 2009, the equivalent cost was \u00a32.78, according to the index. Is Christmas getting cheaper? Separate research that goes back as far as 1968 comes to a similar conclusion. The figures suggest that Christmas dinner last year was the cheapest on record, at \u00a337.37 for a family of four. Back in 1975 the same dinner cost nearly \u00a355, after adjusting for inflation, according to the home interiors firm Hillarys, which compiled the research. Last year a Christmas tree cost an average of \u00a324.99, compared with the equivalent of \u00a3208 in 1975, it says. The reduction in the average cost of this year's Christmas dinner is largely down to the German supermarkets Aldi and Lidl.

The field marshal has been widely expected to resign and declare a presidential bid since the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf) gave its public support at the end of January. Correspondents say he would be likely to win, given his popularity and the lack of any serious rivals.

He said he could \"not turn his back on calls by the majority of Egyptians for him to run for president\", Mena reported. \"Official measures should be taken in the coming days,\" he added. The field marshal added that Egypt was \"going through a critical phase that required unity among the people, army and police\", arguing that \"no party alone can help Egypt get up onto its feet in such conditions\". Officials close to the field marshal have told AFP news agency he will step down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and defence minister after a law regulating the presidential election is approved by Interim President Adly Mansour this week or next. The 59-year-old former military intelligence chief was appointed to the posts by Mr Morsi in August 2012. But after mass protests demanding Mr Morsi's resignation took place on the first anniversary of his taking office, it was the field marshal who gave the president an ultimatum that he would have to satisfy the public's demands or see the army step in. When Mr Morsi refused, Field Marshal Sisi suspended the constitution and announced the formation of a technocratic interim government. Since then, more than 1,000 people have been killed and thousands of members of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have been detained in a crackdown by the interim authorities, who have designated the Islamist movement a terrorist group.

Mrs Clinton has backed Mr Mursi, saying Egyptians should get the government they voted for. Mr Mursi, of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, was elected in June in the country's first ever freely contested leadership vote. After the meeting in Cairo, Mrs Clinton told reporters:  \"I have come to Cairo to reaffirm the strong support of the United States for the Egyptian people and their democratic transition. \"We want to be a good partner and we want to support the democracy that has been achieved by the courage and sacrifice of the Egyptian people.\" The BBC's Jon Leyne, in Cairo, says that not many years ago, one US secretary of state declared that Washington did not speak with the Muslim Brotherhood, and never would. But, he says, the administration of Barack Obama has been quick to engage with the new president - a case of accepting the inevitable and trying to make the best of it. The US government wants to see Egyptian democracy and human rights being protected. The Muslim Brotherhood has repeatedly stressed it does not want to be isolated internationally, not least because the country depends so heavily on international trade and tourism. Mr Mursi has tried to defuse the row over parliament - a body he tried to reinstate by decree last weekend. The chamber was dominated by Mr Mursi's Islamist allies, and was shut down by the military before he took power. The Supreme Constitutional Court has said the dissolution is final. Mr Mursi has said he is \"committed to the rulings of Egyptian judges and very keen to manage state powers and prevent any confrontation\".

The company said the increase was \"an almost inevitable result\" of the drop in the oil price and the consequent cancellation of projects worldwide. It estimates some $200bn (\u00c2\u00a3140bn) worth of projects were cancelled last year. Moore Stephens said the rise in oil and gas firm insolvencies was in stark contrast to 2010, when just four firms went bust in the 12 months to the end of September. \"Oil and gas service companies expanded their businesses over the last decade based on an oil price well above the current one. \"The pain caused by the oil price fall has translated into a rising tide of financial distress across the sector,\" said Moore Stephens head of restructuring and insolvency, Jeremy Willmont. The figures from Moore Stephens come just days after oil services giant Schlumberger said it had cut 10,000 jobs in the past three months amid the plunge in oil prices. Norwegian company DNV GL, an industry consultant, said its survey of 921 senior industry players showed the majority believed the industry was repeating the same mistakes of previous downturns, with 56% concerned over loss of jobs and experience. Nearly three quarters of those it surveyed said they were preparing their company for a sustained period of low oil prices. Law firm Pinsent Masons said its survey showed that many of those in the oilfield services industry were hoping to capitalise on the drop in oil prices by buying up distressed firms. In total, 70% of the 200 senior executives it surveyed were actively considering an acquisition within the next year, it found. Oil prices have fallen by 70% in the past 15 months. The drop in the price of oil has been driven by oversupply, mainly due to US shale oil flooding the market. At the same time, demand has fallen because of a slowdown in economic growth in China and Europe. Historically, Opec has cut production to support prices. But led by Saudi Arabia, by far the group's most powerful member, the group has resolutely refused to trim supply this time.

However, it warned that the UK soft drinks market was experiencing a period of price deflation which could make it more difficult for many businesses to deliver the top-line growth of recent years. Barr also warned that consumer preferences were changing in the soft drinks market, adding that \"areas where traditional growth has been available are now proving more difficult to generate growth, making differentiated brands and appealing to consumers more important than ever\". In its results statement, Barr said Strathmore sales fared particularly well in the stills segment, growing by more than 20% over the year. The brand was boosted by Barr's Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games sponsorship and the growing popularity of water in the UK soft drinks market, the company said. Over the year Irn Bru invoiced sales grew by 1.6%, with sales of Irn Bru ice cream reaching nearly \u00a31m. Barr said its Irn Bru brand performed well in England and Wales, with sales up by 5.6%.

However, Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness said he had been assured by David Cameron that he would not suspend the assembly. Doing so, said Mr McGuinness, would be \"a grave mistake\". A political crisis has been sparked in Northern Ireland following the murder of former IRA man Kevin McGuigan Sr. Police have said they believe IRA members were involved in the shooting. Sinn F\u00e9in has denied this and maintains the Provisional IRA no longer exists. The PSNI chief constable also said there was no evidence that the killing was sanctioned by the organisation. On Wednesday, well-known republican and northern chairman of Sinn F\u00e9in Bobby Storey was one of three men arrested over the murder. Speaking at a press conference later that day, Mr Robinson said: \"If we can't stop the assembly by way of adjournment or suspension then we will take the step that will cause it to be brought to an abrupt halt.\" He said his party had sought a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly's business committee on Thursday. If the DUP could not secure an adjournment of the assembly at that meeting or if the Northern Ireland Secretary would not suspend the assembly, then DUP ministers would stand down, he said. The business committee at Stormont has 10 members drawn from the five main parties, is chaired by the speaker and includes party whips. It generally meets once a week in private while the assembly is sitting. Its main function is to consider what business is to be scheduled for assembly plenary sessions, held on Monday and Tuesday. The current speaker is Sinn F\u00e9in's MLA Mitchel McLaughlin and it is the speaker who has the power to allow a recall of the committee. Unlike important votes in the assembly, votes on the business committee do not require cross-community support, but straight majorities. Committee members cast their votes in proportion to their parties' strengths in the assembly.  For example, DUP members wield 38 votes representing the number of MLAs in the assembly group. Last week, the DUP's request for an adjournment of the assembly was rejected because it only won support from the Alliance Party and was therefore outvoted by the combined votes of the SDLP, Sinn F\u00e9in and the UUP. Mr McGuinness said he had spoken to both Mr Cameron and to Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny. Both were against any suspension. His party, he said, had taken a strong stance against \"violence, criminality and those who would attempt to drag us back to past\". \"We're not going to jump to the tune of the inter-party rivalry that's being played out between both unionist parties at this time,\" he said. \"I think it would be a grave mistake from the British government to suspend these institutions. I think it would send a very negative message. \"Not only do all the politicians have a duty to provide strong, positive and decisive leadership, that must also be provided by the British and Irish governments.\" Meanwhile, BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said a source close to the talks called the situation at Stormont \"very precarious\". \"It's thought 'highly unlikely' the DUP will be granted the adjournment of the assembly they seek, leaving the British government with a choice to suspend the assembly or continue with a situation described as a 'farce', if DUP ministers quit as they have threatened to do,\" she said. The source suggested the adjournment the DUP is asking for is merely a \"gesture\" but that if they follow through on their threat to walk out if it is not granted, the UK government would have little choice but to suspend the assembly \"if it goes into paralysis\". Political talks to try to resolve the crisis are taking place without the Ulster Unionists, who said they would not take part unless the status of the Provisional IRA is resolved. The UUP said it would not return to the talks unless the IRA issue was top of the agenda. Speaking after the DUP statement on Wednesday, UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said it was up to Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams to admit that the IRA existed. \"Gerry Adams has to admit that the IRA exists with a structure, without that, it is all bluster,\" he said. \"Nothing is going to work unless Gerry Adams is honest about the IRA in 2015. It is now over to Sinn F\u00e9in.\" Alliance party leader David Ford has called on other parties to \"stop and think\" before jeopardising the power-sharing institutions permanently. Mr Ford said: \"Alliance is exploring a number of options regarding the future of the Assembly in order to allow parties to take a step back and participate in talks in a calm manner.\" A delegation representing business, churches, unions and the voluntary sector were also at Stormont to call on political leaders to settle the crisis. Reverend Harold Good, who witnessed IRA decommissioning during the peace process, said: \"We are demanding of our politicians that they work at this until they get it sorted because we cannot afford to have our institutions collapse. \"We could be back to square one.\"", "summary": "Its main function is to consider what business is to be scheduled for assembly plenary sessions, held on Monday and Wednesday.", "samples": [{"reason_idx": 16, "prediction": 0, "model": "dav002", "prompt": "fewshot-gwe-prompt1", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "No, the main function of the business committee is to consider what business is to be scheduled for assembly plenary sessions, held on Monday and Tuesday."}, {"reason_idx": 11, "prediction": 0, "model": "ada001", "prompt": "fewshot-gwe-prompt3", "annotation": "no_explanation", "explanation": "No, the summary is not factually correct."}, {"reason_idx": 15, "prediction": 0, "model": "dav002", "prompt": "fewshot-cot-prompt1", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "The document does mention that the business committee's main function is to consider what business is to be scheduled for assembly plenary sessions.

Many of his films - including Kanal, Man of Marble, Man of Iron and Katyn - were inspired by Poland's turbulent wartime and communist history. In 2000, Wajda was awarded an honorary Oscar for his contribution to world cinema. Wajda had been recently taken to hospital. Unconfirmed reports say he died of lung failure. Wajda's last film Powidoki (Afterimage) tells the life story of the avant-garde painter Wladyslaw Strzeminski, who suffered under the post-war Stalinist government in Poland. The director said he wanted to \"warn against state intervention in art\". The film was recently chosen as Poland's official entry for the best foreign language film at the 2017 Oscars. Four of Wajda's earlier works had been nominated for that category. Man of Iron won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1981. Wajda once said that \"the good Lord gave the director two eyes - one to look into the camera, the other to be alert to everything that is going on around him.\" Wajda was born in 1926 in the north-eastern Polish town of Suwalki. His father was among the victims of the Katyn massacre of Polish army officers by the Soviet Union in 1940. Wajda tried to follow in his father's footsteps, but was rejected by a military academy, and joined the Polish resistance in World War Two. During World War Two, Wajda joined the Polish resistance. He later studied to be a painter, before entering the Lodz Film School. In 1955, he made his feature film debut with Generation, set during the German occupation of Warsaw in World War Two.  It was followed by Kanal, and Ashes and Diamonds, which form a trilogy about life in wartime Poland. Some of his films found disfavour with the communist rulers of Poland because of their trenchant portraits of the wartime Warsaw Uprising and the suppression of the Solidarity movement in the 1980s. It was only after the fall of communism in 1989 that he was able to make his film about Katyn. \"I never thought I would live to see the moment when Poland would be a free country,\" Wajda said in a 2007 interview with the Associated Press. \"I thought I would die in that system. It was so surprising and so extraordinary that I lived to see freedom.\" Following Poland's first free elections in 1990, he served for two years as a senator in the upper house of parliament.", "summary": "The film was not recently chosen as Poland's official entry for best foreign language film at the Oscars 2017.", "samples": [{"reason_idx": 28, "prediction": 0, "model": "gpt4", "prompt": "fewshot-cot-prompt1", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "No\n\nReasoning: \nThe summary states that the film was not recently chosen as Poland's official entry for the best foreign language film at the 2017 Oscars, while the document states that the film was indeed recently chosen as Poland's official entry for the best foreign language film at the 2017 Oscars."}, {"reason_idx": 19, "prediction": 0, "model": "dav003", "prompt": "fewshot-gwe-prompt1", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "No, The film was recently chosen as Poland's official entry for best foreign language film at the Oscars 2017 (\u201cThe film was recently chosen as Poland's official entry for the best foreign language film at the 2017 Oscars\u201d)."}, {"reason_idx": 22, "prediction": 0, "model": "cgpt", "prompt": "fewshot-cot-prompt3", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "The document states that:\nWajda's last film, Powidoki, was recently chosen as Poland's official entry for the best foreign language film at the 2017 Oscars.\nTherefore, the summary is factually inconsistent with the document.\nAnswer: No, the summary is not factually correct."}, {"reason_idx": 1, "prediction": 0, "model": "vicuna-13b", "prompt": "fewshot-gwe-prompt1", "annotation": "correct", "explanation": "No, the summary is not factually consistent with the document.

Winger Niyi Adeolokun scored a superb touchdown midway through the half to give Connacht a 15-0 interval lead. Matt Healy scored Connacht's third try on 57 minutes with Sean Cronin giving Leinster some hope 10 minutes later. With Connacht having picked up some injuries, it looked like they might come under serious pressure. But the men from Galway, with skipper John Muldoon making his 275th appearance, had done more than enough to secure the long-awaited and much sought-after silverware. Connacht had never been in the Pro12 final before and they made the most of their historic opportunity, playing adventurous, running rugby to telling effect. For Leo Cullen's Leinster, a record fifth win in the competition must wait for another day. They could only muster a Jonny Sexton penalty and the late Cronin try as they failed to rise to the occasion in front of a record final crowd of almost 35,000. Connacht had booked their place in the play-offs by topping the league table but few gave Ireland's least successful province much hope against the Dublin powerhouse. O'Halloran sprinted home for the opening try after Healy had made great ground. US Eagles fly-half AJ MacGinty nailed the conversion for 7-0, before Adeolokun extended the lead. MacGinty pulled his attempt at the extras wide but made amends with a penalty soon after. Leinster badly needed the first score after the break, and got it through a Sexton penalty. Connacht hooker Tom McCartney almost got through, only to be held up after Sexton's last-gasp tackle. But that only delayed the inevitable, with Connacht's third touchdown coming after 57 minutes when MacGinty saw the space in behind the Leinster defence and measured his grubber kick with precision for Healy to run on and dot down.

It has been proposed that the Sisters of Charity will be sole owners of the new facility at the St Vincent's site. The order are major shareholders in the firm that owns the land. It has been argued they will have no say in what medical procedures are provided. The order has so far failed to pay its share of a compensation scheme for victims of institutional abuse. Dr Boylan is one of a number of people in public life who have questioned the deal. Speaking on the Newstalk radio station, he said: \"I can't remain a member of a board which is so blind to the consequences of its decision to transfer sole ownership of the hospital to the religious Sisters of Charity and so deaf to the concerns of the public which it serves.\" Nicholas Kearns, the deputy chairman of the National Maternity Hospital's executive board, had previously asked Dr Boylan to resign after he criticised the move from the current location on Holles Street. Dr Boylan had said that the Catholic ethos of St Vincent's could in future interfere with the independent operation of a maternity hospital. That claim is disputed by the current master of the hospital, by St Vincent's Hospital and by the Irish Health Minister Simon Harris. Many people believe the deal raises fundamental issues about church-state relations in such areas as health and education, where religious organisations remain the largest service providers. That arrangement dates from an era when church-state relations were much closer during the early period of Irish independence. But, in the wake of a number of scandals involving the Catholic Church and religious-run institutions, there is now more public debate about its role in the state. The Sisters of Charity was one of 18 religious congregations investigated by the Ryan Commission over allegations that children were abused in residential institutions. In 2002, the order was party to a 128m euros (\u00a3107m) indemnity agreement with the Irish state. After the publication of the Ryan Report in 2009, the Sisters of Charity offered to contribute a further 5m euros (\u00a34.2m) towards the 1.5bn euros (\u00a31.2bn) redress costs incurred by the state. The offer has been criticised by some as far too small. The board of the National Maternity Hospital passed a motion of continued support for the move and the St Vincent's group is also expected to maintain its support for a deal that arose from third-party mediation. The health minister, Mr Harris, has appealed for a period of calm reflection on the issue, which is expected to go before Irish cabinet again at the end of May.", "summary": "That arrangement dates from the end of May when church-state relations were much closer during the early period of Irish independence.", "samples": [{"reason_idx": 26, "prediction": 0, "model": "gpt4", "prompt": "fewshot-cot-prompt2", "annotation": "correct", "explanation": "The summary is not factually consistent with the document.

Seven-time major winner Inbee Park is in a group of four on 10 under that includes fellow South Korean So Yeon Ryu, the 2011 US Women's Open champion. The event is back on schedule after delays caused by stormy weather but Thompson was among 56 players who had to complete their second rounds on Saturday before playing the third. The halfway leader, who won the 2014 title, said: \"Experience always helps me out, but I'm just going to focus on one shot at a time, relax out there between shots and just focus on doing my routine.\" Pettersen, winner of the Women's PGA Championship in 2007 and the 2013 Evian Championship, has been runner-up in the event on three occasions and said: \"I'm driving the ball well and that's a major key on this golf course. If you do, you can kind of attack it as well. \"The leaderboard is packed behind me. You've got to expect to go out there and shoot low. There's a lot at stake, but I'm all in for it.\" After two sub-70 rounds, former US Women's Open champion Michelle Wie returned a 71 and shares seventh on eight under.

Hundreds of thousands of migrants have arrived in Europe in recent months, causing divisions among EU states. Almost half a million people arrived in Greece between 20 July and 30 November but Greek authorities have only fingerprinted about 121,000 of them, according to the European Commission. \"Effective implementation of the Eurodac Regulation is essential for the functioning of the Dublin system and EU relocation schemes,\" a statement said. \"The European Commission sent administrative letters to Greece, Croatia and Italy in October. Two months later, concerns have not been effectively addressed.

In Athens on Thursday, 4,500 migrants arrived from Greek islands and 3,000 arrived from the Macedonian border, where authorities have blocked them from travelling further north. Macedonia says it is only accepting migrants from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Athens said some are being accommodated at an Olympic kick box stadium and others at a former airport where the Greek army is erecting tents. The Greek minister for migration, Jannis Muzalas, said new arrivals had to apply for asylum within 30 days or be sent home. Speaking earlier, Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said infringement procedures would be \"unreasonable\". \"For the work we've done, the only thing we deserve from the EU is a thank you,\" he said. Regarding Hungary, the commission said it was not satisfied with the response from Budapest regarding its concerns over tough new asylum legislation, which it said breached EU rules. \"As a consequence of these concerns, the commission has today initiated an infringement procedure and sent a letter of formal notice to Hungary,\" the statement said. Hungary has been a major transit route for migrants, many of whom aim to continue on to Austria and Germany. In September, it fenced off its border with non-EU Serbia to try to stem the flow of migrants, and a month later also closed its border with Croatia for the same reason. New EU statistics released on Thursday showed that a total of 812,705 people had claimed asylum in the bloc in the first nine months of 2015.

Congratulations on being Christmas number one! How will you celebrate? I imagine we'll have some very large shots of Baileys! When you first released Rockabye, did you think it would become this big? We had no idea whatsoever. We were just putting out some music hoping for the best and it's gone crazy. Why do you think people have connected with it so strongly? I don't know. I remember I played it to my girlfriend when we were in the car on holiday and she started crying. I was like, \"What's going on?\". I never felt quite so emotionally affected by it - so that was the first moment where I thought, \"Hang on, there's something interesting going on here,\". When we spoke to Sean Paul recently, he said the lyrics affected him because he was raised by a single mum. Could that be the key? I think so, for some people. I've noticed a lot of comments on YouTube and I've had a lot of direct messages to our Facebook page. People have been really affected by it. They even asked for a hotline number to be put on the video. I just couldn't believe that. It's quite serious but, at the same time, there's a positive feel in the music, so I wonder if it's where those two places meet? The energy in the music and the emotion in the lyrics? You beat Little Mix and Rag N Bone Man to reach number one. What did you think of their songs? I have to be honest, I haven't actually heard them! I keep my head in the sand when it comes to current, popular music. I mostly listen to Fleetwood Mac on my record deck at home. The success of the single means people are even more eager for your new album. How far along is it? Quite far, actually. It's not quite finished but it's pretty much there. Our label want us to focus on releasing singles, so we're doing that and hopefully at some point they'll say, \"Now you can release an album.\" I think that'll be early next year. You told us you'd been recording with Elton John. Will that song still be on the album? It's not quite finished because the focus shifted to Rockabye - but in the New Year we've got a bit of time in the studio and we're definitely going to work on that. Your violinist, Neil Amin-Smith, quit earlier this year. How have the dynamics of the band changed? It's different. He was a great performer and a brilliant violinist. But the band's always changing because we don't have a regular singer. We're always changing personnel because they get fed up of us and move on to other things. And that's happened with Neil\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Well, he didn't get fed up, but he moved on! But we've got to keep the show on the road, and we're working with another couple of violinists, who have been fantastic. It's a real laugh. He left in the middle of recording sessions, so will he still appear on the album? Kind of. The way we work is that, mostly, we do the strings last. The vocals unfortunately end up being the priority because, I guess, that's the first point of contact for most people, and certainly for our label. A different singer might want to sing a semi-tone lower, so until we get the vocals right, we don't record the strings. Neil's departure was timed in such a way that he didn't actually record on Rockabye. He was on our last single, Tears, but not on Rockabye. At one point, bookmakers were offering odds of 66/1 on Rockabye being Christmas number one. Did you have a flutter? No! It's really annoying. But my dad put a bet on it - one quid, which shows his faith in the song! But we were 25/1 at the time, so he can get a round in at the pub!

The Bluebirds and Slade's former side had been in dispute over his proposed appointment at the Welsh club. \"I'm grateful to Vincent [Tan] for giving me this opportunity as Cardiff City is a fantastic football club,\" said Slade.

The comedian explained that he recently lost a stone to play the singer Alice Cooper: \"I get more work when I'm thinner, so I can't put on weight. \"I don't eat anything, I'm like a plant.\" He added: \"It's not that I don't like cake, I have a very sweet tooth.\" The BBC lost the contract to broadcast Bake Off last year after Love Productions, the makers of the show, signed a three-year deal with Channel 4. It is understood the channel offered \u00a325m for the rights, in contrast to the \u00a315m offered by the BBC. Paul Hollywood is the only original member of the BBC line-up to appear on the new series, describing the new C4 line-up - Fielding, Leith and QI host Sandi Toksvig - as a \"dysfunctional family\". Fielding and Toksvig were announced as Bake Off's new presenters in March, after previous hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc announced they \"were not going with the dough\" when the show switched channels. The pair had presented all seven series of the show - since its launch in 2010 - alongside judges Berry and Hollywood. Similarly Berry also announced she would not remain with the show on Channel 4, citing \"loyalty\" to the BBC. Restaurateur and broadcaster Leith - renowned for her no-nonsense attitude as a judge on The Great British Menu - was subsequently announced as Berry's replacement. Asked if the show, with its abundance of cakes and biscuits, fitted with her healthy eating ideals, Leith told the Sunday Times: \"I really thought twice about accepting Bake Off... but I reasoned that, actually, baking is the best way to get people into general cooking.\" \"And that's what we need the nation to do: to get interested in the kitchen.\" \"Even if you don't allow yourself to eat too much cake, you still like drooling over it.\" Bake Off became a huge ratings hits for BBC One, pulling in record-breaking viewing figures. The final BBC episode, broadcast last October, saw an average of 14 million people tune in to see PE teacher Candice Brown crowned the victor. Yet, in the same interview, Fielding intimated that co-host Toksvig, had never previously watched Bake Off. Asked what her favourite episode was, Toksvig said: \"The one where they make cake? I don't watch a lot of television, I'm more of a reader.\"", "summary": "Similarly, Berry also announced that he would not be be staying on the show on Channel 4, citing \"loyalty\" to the BBC.", "samples": [{"reason_idx": 12, "prediction": 0, "model": "bard", "prompt": "fewshot-gwe-prompt3", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "Sure, I can help you with that.\nDocument:\nThe Mighty Boosh star Noel Fielding has said he \"can't put on weight\" because he gets more work when he is thinner.

He is the first young Canaries player to move to New Douglas Park since manager Alex Neil promised to send some of his emerging youths to Accies after his own switch to Norwich last season.

But a spokesman for the US-led coalition has been more cautious, saying a tough fight is in prospect. Iraqi forces are heading towards the main government complex, and have come up against snipers and suicide bombers. Ramadi fell to IS in May in an embarrassing defeat for the Iraqi army. US-led coalition spokesman Col Steve Warren estimates that there are up to 350 IS fighters still in Ramadi in addition to possibly tens of thousands of civilians. There have been reports that IS has been rounding people up, possibly to use as human shields. BBC Middle East editor Sebastian Usher says that the offensive in Ramadi appears to be a more effective Iraqi military operation, helped by months of US training. Notable by their absence, our correspondent says, are powerful Shia militias, who helped recapture Tikrit earlier this year. Their presence would be too incendiary in the Sunni heartland of Ramadi and the surrounding province of Anbar, he adds. Security sources told the BBC troops and allied tribesmen, backed by US-led air strikes, had already retaken two districts, and entered two others. Last month, government forces completed their encirclement of the predominantly Sunni Arab city, about 90km (55 miles) west of Baghdad, cutting off militants inside the centre from strongholds elsewhere in Anbar province and in neighbouring Syria. How tactical change boosted offensive Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service spokesman Sabah al-Numani said its troops, supported by soldiers, police and Sunni tribesmen, begun the assault on central Ramadi at dawn on Tuesday. Sources in the Iraqi military's Anbar Operations Command told the BBC that engineers had built temporary bridges over the River Euphrates, which flows along the north and west of the city centre. This had enabled troops to enter directly the al-Haouz district, south-west of the government complex. By Tuesday afternoon, government forces had retaken the al-Thubat and al-Aramil districts, and entered nearby al-Malaab and Bakir, the sources said. The Iraqi defence ministry said the jihadists had prevented civilians leaving Ramadi since leaflets warning of an assault were dropped over the city last month. Sources inside Ramadi told the BBC IS had carried out a campaign of raids and mass arrests of residents in districts still under its control, in an attempt to prevent an uprising in support of the government offensive. IS has lost control of several key towns in Iraq to government and Kurdish forces since overrunning large swathes of the country's west and north in June 2014 and proclaiming the creation of a \"caliphate\" that also extended into neighbouring Syria. On Monday, analysis by IHS Jane's suggested that IS had lost 14% of its overall territory in Iraq and Syria, about 12,800 sq km (4,940 sq miles), over the past year. Despite this, the group has been able to capture new territory of strategic value over the same period, including Ramadi and Palmyra in Syria's Homs province. It also still controls the Iraqi cities of Falluja, east of Ramadi, and Mosul, in the north. A notoriously violent Islamist group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. IS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory. It adheres to its own extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam and regards non-believers as deserving of death. IS projects a powerful image, partly through propaganda and sheer brutality, and is the world's richest insurgent group. It has about 30,000 fighters but is facing daily bombing by a US-led multinational coalition which has vowed to destroy it.

His government faced major protests in 2010 which paralysed parts of the capital and left more than 90 people dead. Distinctly upper-class, Mr Abhisit hails from a wealthy family of Thai-Chinese origin. Both his parents were medical professors. He was born in the British city of Newcastle in August 1964 and educated at England's top public school, Eton. He then went on to gain a degree in politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) at Oxford University. Mr Abhisit's support is drawn mainly from southern Thailand and from Bangkok's educated middle-classes. He has had less success in attracting the support of working class and rural Thais. In 1992, Mr Abhisit joined Thailand's oldest party, the Democrats, and at the age of 27, entered parliament as one of its youngest ever members. Having tried and failed to become party leader in 2001, he eventually got the post in 2005. Championing a raft of populist policies, Mr Abhisit campaigned under the slogan \"Putting People First\". The Democrat Party failed to win power in national elections in 2007 - the first since the military coup in 2006 that ousted then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Instead, Mr Thaksin's allies won. Months of political pressure by anti-Thaksin protesters followed, including a week-long sit-in at Bangkok's two airports, which shut down air traffic and crippled the tourism industry. In December 2008 the Constitutional Court found the ruling party, led by Mr Thaksin's allies, guilty of electoral fraud and banned it. This enabled Mr Abhisit to form a new government and become the next prime minister without calling elections. At age 44, he became the country's youngest prime minister in more than 50 years. His government has faced major protests; the first in 2009. A year later, in March 2010, Mr Abhisit was spirited away to a barracks when red-shirted opposition protesters marched on Bangkok, denouncing him as an illegitimate leader. In May that year, a military crackdown brought an end to the demonstrators' occupation of the city's commercial district. More than 90 people died in the course of the protests, which hit the economy hard. While not entirely ditching the liberal reforms of \"Thaksinomics\" - a term used to refer to the economic set of policies of the exiled former leader - Mr Abhisit has argued for a more statist approach. Among other things, Mr Abhisit has advocated free healthcare, a higher minimum wage, and free education, including textbooks and milk for nursery-school children. He has also been a consistent campaigner against corruption. When Mr Thaksin called a snap election in February 2006, Mr Abhisit's campaign pitch was that he was \"prepared to become a prime minister who adheres to the principle of good governance and ethics, not authoritarianism\". Later that year, he opposed the military when it overthrew Mr Thaksin in a coup. \"We cannot and do not support any kind of extra-constitutional change, but it is done. The country has to move forward and the best way forward is for the coup leaders to quickly return power to the people and carry out the reforms they promised,\" he said at the time. He also said he expected high standards of probity from his party and any government he led. Going beyond the current transparency rules for Thai MPs, he said he would require all future Democrat Party representatives to declare their assets and any involvement in private companies. However, that has not shielded his government, or party, from corruption allegations, including claims of a cover-up of illegal donations by a petrochemical firm. But the main chink in the Abhisit armour, apart from the impression that his good looks tend to outshine his sometimes rather bland political pronouncements, has been his failure to win the popular vote. His acceptance of defeat in the July 2011 election has done nothing to change that. Before entering parliament, Mr Abhisit had a brief academic career. After Oxford, he taught at Thailand's Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy. Later, he returned to Oxford to study for a Master's degree. He then taught economics at Thammasat University before studying law at Ramkhamhaeng University. Mr Abhisit's family is a circle of accomplished individuals. One of his two sisters is a professor of child psychology, while the other is a leading Thai author. Mr Abhisit's wife is a dentist-turned-mathematics lecturer at Chulalongkorn University.

The former German SS officer, who was jailed for life in 1998 over the killing of more than 300 civilians, died under house arrest last week. His death led to fierce debate over what to do with his body. That question remains after the funeral was suspended on Tuesday evening. The exact reason for the halt in the ceremony is unclear, although Priebke's lawyer, Paolo Giachini, said it had been stopped because the authorities had prevented friends and family entering. The agency quoted Mr Giachini as saying that the funeral was \"a moment of mourning\" that had nothing to do with politics. Priebke was one of the SS officers present during the killing of men and boys at Rome's Ardeatine Caves in 1944, in a reprisal attack ordered by Adolf Hitler for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters. He died aged 100 and had never apologised for his actions. The Vatican had issued an unprecedented ban on holding the funeral in any Catholic church in Rome. Argentina, where Priebke lived for nearly 50 years before being extradited to Italy, has refused to take the body. But the Society of St Pius X - a Catholic splinter group which has in the past faced criticism over anti-Semitic leanings among its members - offered to hold the ceremony. Angry demonstrators who had gathered in Albano Laziale jeered at and hit the hearse carrying Priebke's coffin as it made its way to the funeral. \"Take him to the landfill!\" one man shouted, according to the French news agency AFP. According to Italian media, the coffin was taken into the seminary of the Society of St Pius X, and the service had already begun when protesters broke into the compound. It is unclear whether the body remained in the seminary overnight or was moved to a different location. After World War II, Priebke lived in the Argentine Andean resort of Bariloche, before his identity was discovered in 1994. He was then extradited to Italy and jailed - but because of his age and poor health he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest in Rome.

Mr Trump insists the new measure covers Americans with pre-existing conditions \"beautifully\". But even many Republicans say the bill undermines that popular element of President Barack Obama's signature law. Republicans withdrew a healthcare bill in March to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, after they were unable to secure enough support to pass it. The withdrawal embarrassed the president, who has repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace his predecessor's accomplishment. It was also viewed as a major setback for Republicans, who were unable to rally behind the party's long-held goal to repeal the law, despite control of both the House and Senate. Moderate Republicans were unhappy that the bill cut health coverage too severely, while more conservative lawmakers felt the changes did not go far enough. It has an amendment designed to woo hard-line conservatives, allowing states to ditch key Obamacare insurance regulations. It keeps an Obamacare clause requiring insurers to provide coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, however, it also allows insurers to charge higher rates to those same patients. States could obtain a waiver to allow insurers to charge higher rates based on the \"health status\" of a person if they let their coverage lapse. Insurers could also offer policies that limit benefits for those with pre-existing conditions, which could affect the quality of policies. The new bill's amendment also allows states to apply for permission to opt out of the law's essential health benefits, including maternity, emergency care and mental health. At the centre of debate is whether the new amendment protects Americans with pre-existing conditions such as cancer or diabetes. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan insisted on Tuesday that \"there are a few layers of protections for pre-existing conditions\". Mr Trump told Bloomberg News on Monday: \"I want it to be good for sick people. It will be every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare.\" But critics say the new bill will allow insurance companies to charge sick people at significantly higher rates, ultimately pricing them out of the market. The American Medical Association, the Association of Medical Colleges and other consumer advocacy groups have called on Congress to vote against the measure. How disastrous for Trump is healthcare collapse? The rise of Obamacare: Why is the ACA so popular? With Democrats united in opposition, House Republicans are currently short of the 216 votes they need to pass the bill before the Senate could take it up. They can afford only 22 defections, and the latest whip counts put Republican \"no\" votes at about 20, with a dozen more undecided. Though the amended bill has brought some hard-line conservatives on board, moderate Republicans are hesitant to support a measure that is perceived to weaken protections for sick Americans. Top Republican Fred Upton came out against the measure on Tuesday, saying he was \"not at all comfortable\" with removing protection for people with pre-existing conditions. House Republican Billy Long, who campaigned against Obamacare in 2010, says he will not support the bill. The Missouri lawmaker said it \"strips away any guarantee that pre-existing conditions would be covered and affordable\".

The 4CMenB vaccine, developed by Novartis, has been described as the \"biggest leap forward in the field\" in 30 years by the charity Meningitis UK. The jab was recommended for approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). About a quarter of all survivors of meningitis B are left with life altering after-effects, such as brain damage or limb loss. Children under the age of five are the most at risk from the bacterial infection, which leads to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Recommendations from the EMA are normally endorsed by the European Commission within two or three months. The vaccine, known as Bexsero, is expected to receive its UK licence early next year.  It has been recommended for use in children aged two months and older. Meningitis UK has described the breakthrough as a \"landmark moment in the fight against meningitis\" and wants the jab to be introduced into the government's routine immunisation schedule as a priority. The charity's founder Steve Dayman, whose baby son died of meningitis and septicaemia in 1982, said: \"It is vital that the vaccine is introduced in the UK immunisation schedule as soon as possible. \"It will save countless lives and prevent many people enduring the suffering caused by this devastating disease. \"We will be campaigning hard to make the government introduce it.\" It has taken Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis 20 years to develop the vaccine, which has been complicated by the many different strains of the infection.

A vaccine against the less common meningitis C has been administered since 1999 and is now widely given to babies in the first year of their life.

Outside, traditional Japanese plants and water features make it feel more like Japan than Northern Ireland. Set up nearly two decades ago, in 1996, the group was formed to help Japanese people new to Northern Ireland to integrate, but its members say the society is about much more than that too. On Saturday, the society held its first meeting of the year. The society's secretary, S\u00e9an Greer, said many members joined because they had lived in Japan for a time. \"I used to live in Japan, for about nine years in total, and I came back just at the end of 2003,\" he said. \"I wanted to keep my contact with Japan, I heard about the society and looked them up. People are interested in Japanese culture for a lot of different reasons. \"It might be the language, for a lot of people it's food, for a lot of younger people it's the animation and manga (Japanese cartoons). Everything they do seems to be a little bit different or sometimes very different from our own and therefore it's sort of endlessly fascinating.\" There was plenty of culture on show at the meeting, including a performance by a group of Japanese taiko drummers from Londonderry. One of the group's founders, Fiona Umetsu, said it was an exciting art form, mixing both music and performance. \"Taiko is a part of nearly every Japanese festival that you see, and it's a brilliant part of their summer,\" she said. \"When I lived there I saw it and thought it was amazing, and was lucky enough to be able to join a local group.\" The society was joined by a very special guest - students visiting Belfast from Rikkyo University in Tokyo joined in the festivities. For many of them, it was their first time visiting Belfast and they told me they were keen to stay. \"Belfast is very fantastic and an exciting city, many students say they want to retire here in Northern Ireland,\" their professor said. The Japan society's chairperson, Junko McNeely, said the group provides a way for people who are learning Japanese to practise with native speakers. \"The purpose is to introduce Japanese culture, anything like that to get local people interested in Japan, but it's also a place to communicate and have entertainment with Japanese people as well,\" she said. S\u00e9an Greer said the society also allows Japanese visitors to find out how the western world views their culture. \"If you got to Japan the first question a Japanese person will ask you is:  \"\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u3069\u3046\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\", which means, 'what do you think of Japan?' and they're really curious about what others think of them,\" he said. \"So when they come here they can learn a little bit more about that, and realise what non-Japanese people find interesting about Japan. \"We ourselves are interested to know what other people think of Northern Ireland and we're keen to show them that it's a welcoming place as well.\"", "summary": "\"Taiko is a part of nearly every S\u00e9an Greer festival that you see, and it's a brilliant part of their summer,\" she said.", "samples": [{"reason_idx": 7, "prediction": 0, "model": "claudev13", "prompt": "fewshot-gwe-prompt2", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "No, the summary is not factually correct.\n\nEvidence:\nThe document states that Fiona Umetsu, not Sean Greer, said \"Taiko is a part of nearly every Japanese festival that you see, and it's a brilliant part of their summer,\".

Mr Lloyd said there had been strong support for his proposed bill from external organisations. But the Welsh Government's Ken Skates said the proposals were not feasible. All the opposition groups - Plaid Cymru, UKIP and the Conservatives - supported the proposal, but with Labour opposed AMs voted 28 against to 25 for. Mr Lloyd's bill would have deployed a range of measures to protect names, including establishing a system where people who want to change a historic name must seek consent to do so, and a general prohibition on changing a historical place name. The proposal had followed a series of rows over changes to names over the years, including a dispute where the Grade I-listed Plas Glynllifon near Caernarfon was referred to as Wynnborn mansion in online marketing material. Mr Lloyd had won an assembly ballot to introduce the law earlier this year. During a debate on the bill Mr Skates, Welsh Government culture secretary, told AMs: \"I do not see how any system of general consent or control for changes can be feasible or affordable.\" He explained that, from May, Wales will have the only \"statutory list of historic place names\" and that in guidance set to be issued, public bodies will be directed to take account of the list when considering the name of streets, properties and other places. \"I struggle to see what the legislation that the member proposes will achieve beyond the actions that we are already taking,\" he said. \"Although I cannot support this motion I believe the ground breaking measures that we are about to introduce are vital steps in appreciating and valuing this precious inheritance\", he said, adding this was where \"our energies and our resources should be directed\". Mr Skates's intervention prompted an angry response from Mr Lloyd, who told the minister that it was Plaid Cymru amendments to a previous assembly law that had \"got you to the position of having the register that you have today\". \"The fact is there is no statutory protection for our historic place names, be they of any language - English, Anglo Saxon, Viking, Latin, Old Welsh, New Welsh, Norse, Flemish, the rich smorgasbord of our history is going down the tube.\" He added: \"We're talking history of nation here.

It was no coincidence that a DUP statement effectively denying that any final deal with Theresa May had been reached was published at midnight exactly, not one minute past. As UK voters try to find out what the DUP stands for, there's been an understandable emphasis on their opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage and the outspoken views of some of their representatives denying man made climate change or espousing creationism. However, as the former DUP minister Alastair Ross pointed out on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday, the party encompasses a range of views on these issues. So far as the discussions with Theresa May are concerned, the moral arguments are likely to be a red herring, even though they create an uncomfortable backdrop for many more liberal-minded Tories. Instead the DUP will concentrate on bread and butter politics. That means inward investment in Northern Ireland and more local infrastructure spending. Although to the right on many moral questions, the DUP's economic approach is populist. Many of its 292,000 voters are working class, so the party opposed the Conservative welfare benefit cuts and its most recent manifesto includes a pledge to defend the triple lock on pensions and the winter fuel allowance. Expect it to push these arguments. DUP MPs were some of the most enthusiastic Brexiteers. But when it comes to its practical implementation, the DUP leader Arlene Foster signed a joint letter with the late Martin McGuinness which put her very much on the soft end of the Brexit spectrum. This included a call for flexibility on the Irish border, ease of trade with EU member states and access to both unskilled and highly skilled European labour. Since the DUP-Conservative discussions began, some senior Labour figures involved in the peace process such as former Northern Ireland Secretaries Lord Peter Hain and Shaun Woodward, have expressed concern that Mrs May is abandoning the \"rigorous impartiality\" which both the British and Irish governments signed up to in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Their argument is that this will undermine any attempts to restore the power-sharing executive at Stormont, which collapsed at the start of the year as a result of a row over a controversial and expensive renewable heating scheme. Prior to the election, the Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire was already facing criticism from Irish nationalists about his alleged lack of impartiality regarding dealing with the legacy of Northern Ireland's troubles. That led to a senior civil servant taking over the chairing of much of the talks. But Conservatives argue there's nothing in the Good Friday Agreement which says they can't be in favour of maintaining the UK. David Cameron frequently declared he was a \"passionate unionist\" and in a failed electoral experiment even stood joint candidates with Northern Ireland's smaller unionist party, the Ulster Unionists, back in 2010. The latest rapprochement with the DUP to some extent continues that approach. Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in has accused the DUP of betraying the people of Northern Ireland by propping up the Tories and predicted any arrangement \"will be transitory and end in tears\". If the DUP shopping list contains items like changing the current definition of a troubles victim (which includes perpetrators) or protecting army veterans and former police officers from prosecution for troubles offences, that will seriously annoy republicans. But more funding to blunt the local impact of Brexit might be appreciated across the board. How long any deal will last has to be open to question. But expect the DUP to be canny and to enjoy their moment in the sun.

Russia's economy has been badly hit by low oil prices and Western sanctions over Moscow's role in Ukraine's crisis. It was not clear when the cuts would come into effect, and whether they would cover Mr Putin's own pay. The move is presumably meant to set an example, as Russia enters difficult economic times, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow reports. It is all part of a broader austerity drive, she says, as Russia's income has shrunk along with the falling oil price. Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict are also biting. In a brief statement on Friday, the Kremlin said permanent members of Russia's security council discussed \"a number of social and economic issues\". It added that Mr Putin informed the council about his decision to lower salaries in the presidential administration \"outside the context of the meeting's agenda\". Earlier this week Sergei Naryshkin, the speaker of the State Duma (lower chamber of parliament), said lawmakers should take a 10% pay cut to help the country through a financial crisis. Mr Naryshkin appealed to their patriotism to back his proposal. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has also pledged to reduce the spending by the federal ministries and government agencies by 10% in 2015. In a separate development, Mr Siluanov's first deputy said on Friday the government would ask parliament to allow the spending of up to 3.2tn roubles ($52bn; \u00c2\u00a334bn) from the Reserve Fund, according to Reuters news agency. This would include 500bn roubles already envisaged in the budget for 2015. The Russian government is already revising the budget, which was based on oil prices at $100 a barrel. Prices are now hovering at about $60. The drop in oil income - along with the impact of sanctions following the crisis in Ukraine - has left the country heading for recession, analysts say. Forecasts suggest Russia's economy will contract this year by up to 4%. This week supermarkets announced a price freeze on essential items to help struggling customers. Pharmacies are set to follow. It is all a long way from the boom times that have characterised much of Mr Putin's presidency, our correspondent says, but so far it seems his personal rating is unshaken.

Head coach Gatland is set to name his squad of 37-39 players at midday on Wednesday. Gatland and his coaches will meet for a final selection meeting on Tuesday, with Lions sources insisting nothing is yet set in stone.

Joseph has been tipped by many pundits to start the Test series at outside centre, but Gatland's preference for size in the midfield could see the likes of Te'o and Wales' Jonathan Davies preferred. Meanwhile, despite captaining England to back-to-back Six Nations titles, Hartley is struggling to force his way into the squad as one of the three hookers, with Ireland's Rory Best and Wales' Ken Owens vying for places along with England second-choice Jamie George.

The firm says the change will mean applicants will find out if they have got a job within two working days. It made the change following research suggesting millennials were frustrated by lengthy recruitment processes. KPMG said its survey- conducted among 400 of this summer's new graduates applying for a graduate job at a UK firm - found that more than one-third were annoyed about how long they had to wait to hear the outcome of an interview, and how long the recruitment process took. But the biggest complaint, made by more than half of those surveyed, was about not receiving any feedback if they were unsuccessful. KPMG chairman Simon Collins said the company felt it had to make the changes to make sure it could compete with smaller start-up or tech firms, which often offer a faster recruitment process, to secure the best graduate employees. \"We are competing with the full gamut for the best brains and talent leaving university: getting our graduate recruitment right is crucial to the long-term success of our business,\" he said. The accountancy firm's move comes in the wake of several other big firms shaking up their graduate recruitment process. In June, Goldman Sachs said it had scrapped face-to-face interviews on university campuses in a bid to attract a wider range of talent. The US investment bank has now switched to video interviews with first-round undergraduate candidates, in a move aimed at helping it to attract graduate recruits from a broader range of disciplines. And last year, professional services firm professional services firm Deloitte said it had changed its selection process so recruiters did not know where candidates had gone to school or university. It said the move was aimed at preventing \"unconscious bias\" and recruiting a more diverse \"talent pool\". Millennials will make up 75% of the global workforce by 2025.

Experts say that with further development, it could find applications in cleaning up oil spills and waste water. Details of the new soap, which contains iron atoms, are reported in the chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie. It is similar to ordinary soap, but the atoms of iron help form tiny particles that are easily removed magnetically. \"If you'd have said about 10 years ago to a chemist: 'Let's have some soap that responds to magnets', they'd have looked at you with a very blank face,\" said co-author Julian Eastoe of the University of Bristol. He told BBC News: \"We were interested to see, if you went back to the chemical drawing board with the tool-kit of modern synthetic chemistry, if you could...design one.\" Soap is made of long molecules with ends that behave differently: One end of the molecule is attracted to water and the other is repelled by it. The \"detergent\" action of soap comes from its ability to attach to oily, grimy surfaces, with the \"water-hating\" end breaking up molecules at that surface. The soap molecules then gather up into droplets in which all the \"water-loving\" ends face outward. Prof Eastoe and his team started with detergent molecules that he said were \"very similar to what you'd find in your kitchen or bathroom\" - one of which can be found in mouthwash. The team found a way to simply add iron atoms into the molecules. The droplets that the soap formed were attracted to a magnet, just as iron filings would be. But single iron atoms would not behave as tiny individual magnets, so some other process had to be at work. To get a look at what was going on in the chemical process required a view at the molecular level. So the team sent their samples to the Institute Laue Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France, where an intense beam of the sub-atomic particles known as neutrons shed light on the matter. They saw that the iron particles were clumping neatly together into iron nanoparticles, tiny clumps of iron that could in fact respond to a magnetic field. Prof Eastoe said the research was still at the laboratory stages but was already the subject of discussion. \"The research at the University of Bristol in this field is about how we can take the ordinary and give it extraordinary properties by chemical design,\" he said. \"We have uncovered the principle by which you can generate this kind of material and now it's back to the drawing board to make it better.\"", "summary": "Prof. Eastoe and her team started with detergent molecules that he said were \"very similar to what would in your kitchen or bathroom\" - one of which is found in mouthwash.", "samples": [{"reason_idx": 10, "prediction": 0, "model": "dav002", "prompt": "fewshot-gwe-prompt3", "annotation": "incorrect", "explanation": "No, the summary is factually incorrect.\n\nThe document does not mention anything about Prof. Eastoe or her team."}, {"reason_idx": 5, "prediction": 0, "model": "bard", "prompt": "fewshot-cot-prompt2", "annotation": "unrelated", "explanation": "Document:\nNovak Djokovic remains on course to win a record-equaling 22nd grand slam title after beating American Tommy Paul in straight sets in the Australian Open semifinals Friday, setting up a mouthwatering final with Stefanos Tsitsipas.

As a result, Mrs Goddard dropped her plans before she died last November. She was one of five directors of Evans Estates, which includes much of Bantham village as well as a long sandy beach and surrounding farmland. Her husband Tony, 74, said she had been keen for the village to be left \"several million pounds\" as a trust fund after her death. He said she changed her mind after the firm's decision to allow a refreshments bus on the beach car park provoked several letters of complaint from villagers. He said the estate had charged an entrance fee for Bantham beach car park but it had otherwise been free from commerce until three years ago when a surf school and the food bus were allowed. He said the aim was to offset rising costs and give visitors a chance to buy refreshments. He said: \"Gill's life's work was to look after Bantham. But one of things people asked for is whether they could get some food or drink on the beach. \"So they introduced a Gastrobus to avoid putting in some great big cafe, because they thought it would be environmentally friendly.\" He said the idea for the Gastrobus \"provoked an enormous reaction\" from a \"small number of villagers\" who objected to commercialisation of the area. A number of people wrote to Evans Estates with their objections. Mr Goddard said: \"She was deeply upset by the suggestion that she and her fellow directors, having looked after the estate for all these years, would do something that was against that policy of preserving the estate. \"Her idea of leaving her company shares on the estate on trust for the village disappeared overnight.\" He added that there had been no specific plans for the trust fund, just that it should be used for the benefit of the village. Nick Grodhunce, one of the opponents of the Gastrobus, said he was \"saddened\" that the trust fund had been dropped by Mrs Goddard. He said: \"Both Tony and Gilly did a huge amount of work to preserve what we have here and it is to their credit. \"It is sad but my personal opinion is that the community people have clearly stated that they want to preserve whatever Evans Estates said should be preserved.\" The Bantham estate, owned by Mrs Goddard's family for nearly 100 years, is due to be marketed in May.

Fellow co-captain Matt Garvey was also left limping, in the second half, although there was some relief for both Bath boss Blackadder and Wales as Taulupe Faletau came through 55 minutes unscathed after injury.

Here in the UK, a key part of the government's counter-terrorism strategy is called Prevent. It is a programme aimed at stopping more people getting drawn towards violent extremism. But given the current trends listed above, is it failing? \"Of course it is failing,\" says Aminul Hoque, a lecturer and author on British Islamic identity at the University of London. \"As a strategy, as a government policy document, it has not worked. The irony is that it has become counter-productive. \"If the idea was to understand the roots of extremism, the roots of radicalisation, by putting a magnifying glass across the Muslim communities of Great Britain, what has happened is that has widened the schism between the 'Muslim' us and the British 'other'.\" The Home Office, not surprisingly, disputes this view. \"We made sure Prevent would tackle all forms of terrorism, not just Islamist-related terrorism,\" their spokesman told me, adding that the programme was given a major overhaul in 2011. The problem is that regardless of best intentions, if the programme is widely perceived as being discriminatory then it inevitably runs the risk of failure. With an annual budget of \u00c2\u00a340m, the Prevent programme is one of four strands of CONTEST, the acronym given to the government's multi-pronged counter-terrorism strategy. The other strands are Pursue, Prepare and Protect. Of these four strands it is the most controversial and arguably the least successful. Its stated aim is to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. Yet in the 12 years since its inception, the number of UK suspects coming to the attention of the police and security service has ballooned into the thousands. Unlike Pursue, where success can be measured to some degree by the number of arrests and convictions, Prevent is a less clearly defined area that overlaps into sensitive areas like community cohesion. The Home Office says there are now Prevent programmes in place in all key sectors, including local government, health, education, prisons, immigration and charities. Since 2011, a team dedicated to removing extremist material from the internet has taken down over 75,000 pieces of \"unlawful terrorist material\". The government says it has worked with over 250 mosques and 50 faith groups, distributing over 200,000 leaflets and posters in five languages warning people not to travel to Syria. It also refers people to the \"Channel programme\", a de-radicalisation process that uses psychologists, social workers and religious experts to help counsel thousands of people considered vulnerable to extremist ideas. Some have been stopped literally as they were about to board a plane heading to Syria. Hannah Stuart, research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, a right-wing think-tank in London, says Prevent has had its successes but they are hard to quantify. \"There have been more incidents recently with community centres reporting their concerns to the police and agencies. We have seen potential incidents of terrorism stopped,\" she says. \"It is the messages we need to challenge... whether that is online or on the streets... we need to be equipping our young people with the critical thinking to assess those messages to be able to challenge them.\" Dr Matthew Wilkinson, director of the think-tank Curriculum for Cohesion and an expert on Islamic ideology, believes part of the solution lies in better religious education. \"A very unhealthy gap has developed between the quality and status of religious education in schools because it is often a marginal subject. \"So for example, you get a statistic where 89% of British Muslim youngsters see Islam as their main identifier but RE is the least popular subject. So that speaks of a huge gap which RE is not filling in to create a proper place for young people.\" Dr Wilkinson, whose expertise in Islamic theology has been used in 11 recent legal cases, is of the same view as the author Aminul Hoque when it comes to the success or failure of Prevent. The government's counter-terrorism strategy has been remarkably successful at the level of security and the basic protection of British citizens, he says, with any number of plots foiled and people brought to justice.

In an article for the Institute of Welsh Affairs, he called for closer links with universities, with the aim of long term, sustainable job creation.

The Welsh government set up seven enterprise zones in 2011 and 2012 to encourage new firms in specific industries: Mr Hedges said lessons had to be learned from enterprise zones of the 1980s - which included Swansea - saying reports showed up to 80% of the jobs created had been lost elsewhere, especially in retail. \"In Swansea, the term enterprise zone is used as an alternative name for an out-of-town shopping area,\" he said.
