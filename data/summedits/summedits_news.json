Another organizer in a high-visibility jacket directed cars to drive slowly through the demonstration.\n\nA large group of spectators gathered to watch the protest as cars continued to pass through, picking up yellow and blue paint on their tires.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe group responsible for the stunt, Led by Donkeys, wrote in a statement: \"Tomorrow is the first anniversary of Putin's imperialist invasion of Ukraine, an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination.

They are currently being detained at a West London police station.\n\nLed by Donkeys is an art activist group that formed to protest Brexit, but its focus has since grown to address other social issues. The name Led by Donkeys comes from the phrase 'lions led by donkeys,\" a saying from the First World War that referred to the belief that British soldiers were being led to their deaths by incompetent leaders.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe activists said they created the massive flag in front of the Russian embassy with 170 litres of yellow paint spread in the eastbound lane and a similar amount of blue paint in the westbound lane. They noted the paint was \"high-standard, non-toxic, solvent-free, eco-friendly, fast-dry edible paint designed for making road art.\"\n\nOne Londoner who drove through the protest shared a photo on Twitter of his blue-tinted wheels.\n\n\"Shame about my wheels,\" he wrote. \"Still, that protest put a huge smile on my face!\"\n\nHaha!

Driscoll, the assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York field office said Watson \"repeatedly attempted to entice both investors and lenders through a series of deliberate deceptions and fabrications.\"\n\nAuthorities say Watson and his business partners, between 2018 and 2021, attempted to defraud investors and lenders of \"tens of millions of dollars through fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions\" about the company's debts and other key financial information.\n\nOn multiple occasions, the U.S. attorney's office said, Watson and his colleagues pretended to be other media executives to cover up earlier misrepresentations.", "summary": "The founder of the struggling digital start-up Ozy Media has been arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially unstable company.", "label": 1, "original_summary": "The founder of the troubled digital start-up Ozy Media has been arrested on fraud charges as part of a scheme to prop up the financially struggling company.", "edit_types": []}, {"id": "63f9455b8d931ba6e664fb89_og", "doc": "Moderna, Inc.'s revenues from its COVID-19 vaccines have begun an anticipated decline, reflecting the broader trend in drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 as the pandemic begins to wind down, and it is forecasting a steep drop in coronavirus vaccine sales in 2023.

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nRaimondo spoke at Georgetown University as she moved on to the next phase of the heady task of handing out about $50 billion in government funds to spur semiconductor manufacturing and research in the years ahead. The money was approved in 2022 when President Biden signed the CHIPs and Science Act into law.\n\nThe speech comes after months of intense lobbying from the semiconductor sector. Companies like Intel (INTC); Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and even the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have scored visits from President Biden to tout plans for new U.S. plants in the works-- and they appear well positioned to take large pieces of the coming windfall. Meanwhile, Raimondo and other officials promise that the funds will be spread across the industry among a range of companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Everyone is going to want to know, how much money is Intel getting, how much money is Samsung getting,\" she said during her remarks, promising answers in the weeks ahead. The Commerce Secretary focused her remarks instead on America's national security imperatives and what the semiconductor fabrication plants and research facilities will look like.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel's Vice President of U.S. Government Relations Allen Thompson praised the rollout and this week's focus on building semiconductor ecosystems in a statement to Yahoo Finance calling the law \"the most significant competition policy in our generation.\" He also noted added that his company has already announced $43.5 billion of investments in their U.S. sites since the law's passage.\n\nThe overall ambition is for the U.S. to supplant places like Taiwan, South Korea, and China to become the \"premier destination in the world\" for the sector, Raimondo said. She added during a briefing with reporters that \"every chip company will need to be in the United States of America long after the subsidy runs out because they will have to and want to be here because we will have built that ecosystem.\"\n\n'That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable'\n\nThe Biden administration's challenge: reverse what expert call a downward spiral for the industry in the U.S. in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nRaimondo also reached out to semiconductor companies focused on chip design like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA) who had been worried about being left out of the government windfall as the bill was being negotiated.\n\n\"Our success will be short-lived\" if we focus only on manufacturing Raimondo said Thursday, adding that R&D is what will make it a longer term success.\n\n\"It's one thing to get companies here, we need them to stay here,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Dario Gil, a senior vice president at IBM, congratulated the administration on the unveiling and added \"as a global leader in semiconductor research and development, IBM stands ready to work with our academic and manufacturing partners to implement new technologies and rapidly scale industrial innovation.\"\n\nThe new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers with an additional $11 billion to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design purposes. In addition, the law includes an investment tax credit of up to 25 percent towards a manufacturer's capital expenditures.\n\nReturn on investment?

American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August.

American semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to only 12% in recent years, according to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which were manufactured overseas in 2019. But the recent the announcements from companies like Intel for new U.S. plants could grow U.S. manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo noted that, at the moment, the U.S. relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for 92% of our advanced chips. \"That's a vulnerability that's unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 in August.
