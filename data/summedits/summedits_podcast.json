He had a copy of the game and let me play it on his desktop while my parents looked over his dorm room and chat it before we went out to eat from that moment on I was hooked for Christmas that same Year. My brother made me a bootleg copy of the game that quickly blossomed into me saving all of my money to invest in each new expansion pack as they came out. I had to have them all.

So, how did I get here making a podcast about the amazing community members that make up the Sims?

He had a copy of the game and let me play it on his desktop while my parents looked over his dorm room and chat it before we went out to eat from that moment on I was hooked for Christmas that same Year. My brother made me a bootleg copy of the game that quickly blossomed into me saving all of my money to invest in each new expansion pack as they came out. I had to have them all.

Hello and welcome back to nothing. But a bob thing I am Justin The Fierce and he is Justin. I'm Nathan the brave. Yeah, I mean you're brave in your own way. I mean, I think you're brave enough. I get out of the house every day. That's pretty brave. If I say so but you put your pants on one leg at a time just like everybody know I'm brave. I put I put my pants on two legs at a time. You've got a wire. Suspended I jump in time to jump into my pants evidence out of your bed. It takes 10 to 15 tries. But I eventually nailed it. What a way to start the day. Hmm. That's why you don't have to drink coffee. You've already fallen. It's yeah, I mean, I may have a concussion by the time I get to work but my pants were on and that's what matters dr. S you so how did you get the concussion you play a contact sport? Yes. Oh tonight friends. We are going to be journeying down a lazy river, but For that it is traditional on the show to have some sort of little factoid about Bob in this case today. We have a bob news story who's Bob news Bob news, but new All Rise. So I think we can all agree that the late Bob Ross has really not gotten the respect. He deserves in the art community. Yes. Weather whether you really like what he makes or not. He is a very influential art figure indeed and he deserves some recognition. I think we on this show were championing that in our own small way. Well, let me tell you Bob Ross is finally having some paintings featured in the museum exhibition. You're kidding. It's taken him being dead 24 years to finally get done. Wow, but the DePaul Art Museum. Okay, Chicago. Oh wow is having an exhibition called New Age strategies for survival. Ooh, I like that. Wow. So for of his landscape paintings, which represent self-care in the New Age movement. Yeah are included in the exhibition. That is excellent. Yeah. So do you think of price of a bob painting just shot way up? I mean, I would assume so once you get featured in a museum or recognized yeah, which is it's ludicrous that hasn't happened so far. I mean good on you too. Paul Museum this a which which ones which pieces it doesn't say. Okay. Well, we'll have to keep following this story. I'd be really curious to know. So this is his official Museum debut. Okay, his work has once been loaned out to the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library Okay, not really. Yeah an art museum per se right, right. I mean to be fair. I haven't been to the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library. Maybe it's full of great art. Are we to suppose then that Lyndon B Johnson was a fan but Bob Ross and The Joy of Painting. I mean, I guess I would like to know that it would be really random if if Lyndon B Johnson just didn't care about Bob Ross. Yeah. Anyway, I did stick. There's just one guy who's like, you know, it'd be awesome. Bob Ross. Did London like it? Yeah, but Bob I films job like four years ago curating for this this library and man we have had some wild shit up in here man. We're just gonna put Bob floored fucking ceiling every day man and blast of fucking Fish Man top volume, you know, I'm saying Trey Anastasio man. Fuck I got some cushion the back you want some the Lyndon B Johnson library has the world's largest fish bootleg collections. That's right. No one can prove. I'm wrong in the house employees which are all those people like Park Rangers. Yeah. They probably are see they're like super hippie Park Rangers. I love this idea. So what was the name of the exhibit again at the museum in Chicago? Chicago new age New Age. Yeah to nuages MMM don't know why: strategies for survival. I like the strategies for survival. That seems I wonder what other artists are going to be in the exhibit to I'm glad you asked. Okay Rashid Johnson not familiar Tony or Isler and Robert Pruitt. We should know these people but we don't because we're not real are. Oh, I know all those people again. You can't prove it strip. No, but I the the strategies for survival. Yeah, I mean that's kind of been one of the thesis that we've had on this show is that you know, people are turning back to Bob as a way to relax in this crazy world much like ASMR much like the CBD phenomenon. People are just trying to relax. Yeah. It's very very difficult to relax when you're on your screens constantly. Yes. Listening to Cheeto Hitler. Yeah, you know things like that out off at the mouth. Yeah, I spew. Yeah. I mean there's there's a lot going on. There's a lot of tension. Mmm, and even I mean even the mall soft and vaporwave music, I feel like there's an element of relaxation doll that that one's more confusion painting painting you work with a great deal of Illusions. So in addition to Our Bob news we just before recording tonight. We just put it out on Twitter to the twitterverse. Hey any questions for us as we record tonight and our good friend Chris on Twitter who listens to both this show and our other shows who jackknife which you're more than welcome to listen to the content varies significantly, it would be very strange if you forbid them from listening to it. You were forbidden. Yeah, Chris a Asks, I'm not sure if you guys answered this in a past episode. But what is your first memory of Bob Ross? So I'll go first okay because mine is not interested. Okay. I don't have a specific memory. Gotcha. I just remember it being on TV show all the time. Sure my family we didn't have cable. Yeah for most of my life no cable. No satellite anything like that. So we had ABC Fox CBS NBC PBS right maybe TBM. Yeah, in case you wanted to listen to a preacher quote heal someone or through a dollars on a stage. Yeah. I'm just imagining a strip club Church strip club church. So, you know you flip through the channels just like six choices. Yeah. And Bob was one of them. Yeah, I grew up very similar to you didn't have satellite. There wasn't ever cable. I mean I saw cable it other people's houses and stuff, but I'd heard I'd heard of it. Yeah, but I mostly grew up in a pretty rural area with whatever we could pick up on rabbit ears back before your digital antenna kids and yeah similar it was, you know, ABC Fox CBS all the networks and BC and then yeah, we would pick up PBS. Okay, and we also picked up this channel called packs. Oh, yeah, which was like a sewer pipe. I left them off the list. Yeah. Now I feel bad packs came in clear than anything else. Honestly, that's because it had the Lord's power button. And so the best shows on packs were Diagnosis Murder featuring your And in mind Dick Van Dyke, yeah all all the old reruns diagnosis murder and his son Barry Van Dyke, I think bear bear bear and their family is what Van Dyke brown is named after PS. You don't know if that's true. Yeah, I'm sure it's fine. So packs would run that and then at night my favorite thing. Maybe I was trying to chill out. They would have nature scenes with this like classical very light remember this I do like classical music in the background be like a water faucet. It's like a live-action Bob Ross painting really this would come on like whenever Dana's murder went off the air or like what was the show? Highway to Heaven Michael Landon, where are",

So in addition to Our Bob news we just before recording tonight. We just put it out on Twitter to the twitterverse. Hey any questions for us as we record tonight and our good friend Chris on Twitter who listens to both this show and our other shows who jackknife which you're more than welcome to listen to the content varies significantly, it would be very strange if you forbid them from listening to it. You were forbidden. Yeah, Chris a Asks, I'm not sure if you guys answered this in a past episode. But what is your first memory of Bob Ross? So I'll go first okay because mine is not interested. Okay. I don't have a specific memory. Gotcha. I just remember it being on TV show all the time. Sure my family we didn't have cable. Yeah for most of my life no cable. No satellite anything like that. So we had ABC Fox CBS NBC PBS right maybe TBM. Yeah, in case you wanted to listen to a preacher quote heal someone or through a dollars on a stage. Yeah. I'm just imagining a strip club Church strip club church. So, you know you flip through the channels just like six choices. Yeah. And Bob was one of them. Yeah, I grew up very similar to you didn't have satellite. There wasn't ever cable. I mean I saw cable it other people's houses and stuff, but I'd heard I'd heard of it. Yeah, but I mostly grew up in a pretty rural area with whatever we could pick up on rabbit ears back before your digital antenna kids and yeah similar it was, you know, ABC Fox CBS all the networks and BC and then yeah, we would pick up PBS. Okay, and we also picked up this channel called packs. Oh, yeah, which was like a sewer pipe. I left them off the list. Yeah. Now I feel bad packs came in clear than anything else. Honestly, that's because it had the Lord's power button. And so the best shows on packs were Diagnosis Murder featuring your And in mind Dick Van Dyke, yeah all all the old reruns diagnosis murder and his son Barry Van Dyke, I think bear bear bear and their family is what Van Dyke brown is named after PS. You don't know if that's true. Yeah, I'm sure it's fine. So packs would run that and then at night my favorite thing. Maybe I was trying to chill out. They would have nature scenes with this like classical very light remember this I do like classical music in the background be like a water faucet. It's like a live-action Bob Ross painting really this would come on like whenever Dana's murder went off the air or like what was the show? Highway to Heaven Michael Landon, where are",

Hello and welcome back to nothing. But a bob thing I am Justin The Fierce and he is Justin. I'm Nathan the brave. Yeah, I mean you're brave in your own way. I mean, I think you're brave enough. I get out of the house every day. That's pretty brave. If I say so but you put your pants on one leg at a time just like everybody know I'm brave. I put I put my pants on two legs at a time. You've got a wire. Suspended I jump in time to jump into my pants evidence out of your bed. It takes 10 to 15 tries. But I eventually nailed it. What a way to start the day. Hmm. That's why you don't have to drink coffee. You've already fallen. It's yeah, I mean, I may have a concussion by the time I get to work but my pants were on and that's what matters dr. S you so how did you get the concussion you play a contact sport? Yes. Oh tonight friends. We are going to be journeying down a lazy river, but For that it is traditional on the show to have some sort of little factoid about Bob in this case today. We have a bob news story who's Bob news Bob news, but new All Rise. So I think we can all agree that the late Bob Ross has really not gotten the respect. He deserves in the art community. Yes. Weather whether you really like what he makes or not. He is a very influential art figure indeed and he deserves some recognition. I think we on this show were championing that in our own small way. Well, let me tell you Bob Ross is finally having some paintings featured in the museum exhibition. You're kidding. It's taken him being dead 24 years to finally get done. Wow, but the DePaul Art Museum. Okay, Chicago. Oh wow is having an exhibition called New Age strategies for survival. Ooh, I like that. Wow. So for of his landscape paintings, which represent self-care in the New Age movement. Yeah are included in the exhibition. That is excellent. Yeah. So do you think of price of a bob painting just shot way up? I mean, I would assume so once you get featured in a museum or recognized yeah, which is it's ludicrous that hasn't happened so far. I mean good on you too. Paul Museum this a which which ones which pieces it doesn't say. Okay. Well, we'll have to keep following this story. I'd be really curious to know. So this is his official Museum debut. Okay, his work has once been loaned out to the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library Okay, not really. Yeah an art museum per se right, right. I mean to be fair. I haven't been to the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library. Maybe it's full of great art. Are we to suppose then that Lyndon B Johnson was a fan but Bob Ross and The Joy of Painting. I mean, I guess I would like to know that it would be really random if if Lyndon B Johnson just didn't care about Bob Ross. Yeah. Anyway, I did stick. There's just one guy who's like, you know, it'd be awesome. Bob Ross. Did London like it? Yeah, but Bob I films job like four years ago curating for this this library and man we have had some wild shit up in here man. We're just gonna put Bob floored fucking ceiling every day man and blast of fucking Fish Man top volume, you know, I'm saying Trey Anastasio man. Fuck I got some cushion the back you want some the Lyndon B Johnson library has the world's largest fish bootleg collections. That's right. No one can prove. I'm wrong in the house employees which are all those people like Park Rangers. Yeah. They probably are see they're like super hippie Park Rangers. I love this idea. So what was the name of the exhibit again at the museum in Chicago? Chicago new age New Age. Yeah to nuages MMM don't know why: strategies for survival. I like the strategies for survival. That seems I wonder what other artists are going to be in the exhibit to I'm glad you asked. Okay Rashid Johnson not familiar Tony or Isler and Robert Pruitt. We should know these people but we don't because we're not real are. Oh, I know all those people again. You can't prove it strip. No, but I the the strategies for survival. Yeah, I mean that's kind of been one of the thesis that we've had on this show is that you know, people are turning back to Bob as a way to relax in this crazy world much like ASMR much like the CBD phenomenon. People are just trying to relax. Yeah. It's very very difficult to relax when you're on your screens constantly. Yes. Listening to Cheeto Hitler. Yeah, you know things like that out off at the mouth. Yeah, I spew. Yeah. I mean there's there's a lot going on. There's a lot of tension. Mmm, and even I mean even the mall soft and vaporwave music, I feel like there's an element of relaxation doll that that one's more confusion painting painting you work with a great deal of Illusions.

Be sure to check out the link down in the description box below. We are back for another Triple Threat Sports podcast. Now before we get into the Super Bowl edition of Triple Threat Sports podcast. I got to introduce you guys to my co-host first co-host. Say what up C ewan's what up next you guys know him as UT X JG to dine, but he's also known as the The LA Rams supporter and he's going to the Superbowl. Say what up, GG don't it? Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games. You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that. Also. I know everybody I know that was a big controversy with the Saints in Ramsgate the we'll get to a little bit but Once again the game being decided in overtime with the sudden death the touchdown thing. I think kind of killed the excitement of the game because everybody else started talking about like well, obviously if the pages margin for the wind, it doesn't seem fair and I can see I mean I've been talking about these overtime rules the NFL for years now, even when they switch to this it's better than what it was before it definitely is it makes no sense to make it to where or you have a chance to go for it with field goals, but not touch. Donna to me. That's that's dumb. Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

Donna to me. That's that's dumb. Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

I got to introduce you guys to my co-host first co-host. Say what up C ewan's what up next you guys know him as UT X JG to dine, but he's also known as the The LA Rams supporter and he's going to the Superbowl. Say what up, GG don't it? Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games. You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that.

Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games. You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that.

Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games. You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that. Also. I know everybody I know that was a big controversy with the Saints in Ramsgate the we'll get to a little bit but Once again the game being decided in overtime with the sudden death the touchdown thing.

Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games. You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that. Also. I know everybody I know that was a big controversy with the Saints in Ramsgate the we'll get to a little bit but Once again the game being decided in overtime with the sudden death the touchdown thing.

Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games.

Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that. Also. I know everybody I know that was a big controversy with the Saints in Ramsgate the we'll get to a little bit but Once again the game being decided in overtime with the sudden death the touchdown thing.

I think kind of killed the excitement of the game because everybody else started talking about like well, obviously if the pages margin for the wind, it doesn't seem fair and I can see I mean I've been talking about these overtime rules the NFL for years now, even when they switch to this it's better than what it was before it definitely is it makes no sense to make it to where or you have a chance to go for it with field goals, but not touch. Donna to me. That's that's dumb. Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

I got to introduce you guys to my co-host first co-host. Say what up C ewan's what up next you guys know him as UT X JG to dine, but he's also known as the The LA Rams supporter and he's going to the Superbowl. Say what up, GG don't it? Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games. You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that.

I think kind of killed the excitement of the game because everybody else started talking about like well, obviously if the pages margin for the wind, it doesn't seem fair and I can see I mean I've been talking about these overtime rules the NFL for years now, even when they switch to this it's better than what it was before it definitely is it makes no sense to make it to where or you have a chance to go for it with field goals, but not touch. Donna to me. That's that's dumb. Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

Feel so good though. It feels so good. The lone person the triple threat Sports podcast by team is going to the shelf and people are mad and we gonna talk about it man. We got we definitely going to talk about it for sure. So at the time of this recording we've already gone through the Pro Bowl which was yesterday. I'm sure some of you guys watched it and you know whoopty whoopty Doo I've Interest in the Pro Bowl after like I turned I 15 but AFC 126 to 7, but we're going to talk about these NFL Conference Championship games. You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that.

I think kind of killed the excitement of the game because everybody else started talking about like well, obviously if the pages margin for the wind, it doesn't seem fair and I can see I mean I've been talking about these overtime rules the NFL for years now, even when they switch to this it's better than what it was before it definitely is it makes no sense to make it to where or you have a chance to go for it with field goals, but not touch. Donna to me. That's that's dumb. Why is it why can't it just be any score if you if you march down the field the other ball first and you score period whether it's a field goal whether it's a whether it's a touchdown, why can't the other team had the chance to try to get that also it doesn't make sense that it's only for funerals. I never understood that logic but you know, that's it is the rules and I think though this magnifies being the deal it was such an entertaining game, you know, I think a lot more people are now starting to question. Like why why why is it that the Patriots win just because they can Touchdown not give the cheese chance because I would think everybody would assume that the cheese can easily support session also because the way the game was going they were going back and forth at the end, but, you know, we'll never know. That's the rules it always seems to always benefit that the Patriots in the end. So whoever won the coin toss, which we already do whatever have their out with Paisley to win the coin toss. They could say that about somebody's gonna win. He's gonna get the touchdown and sure enough. It happened. It was like kind of destroy it for me, but you actually just a joy to coach these Tom Brady and They're back in it again. My third year in a row by the way, man, JG man your thoughts go for it. Yes. Well, I didn't get to see the majority of the game. I did up coming back home around the fourth quarter. Are you are partnering. Yeah, you were celebrating. Yeah, but not not I wasn't partying actually has some some wedding stuff to do. So look at that man being an adult. Look at you. Yeah, man. Yeah gonna be an adult. So um, but when I did see personally I was like yo like Okay, first of all garage showed up, so he stopped just strictly blocking. They actually used him and he was very effective Edelman was very effective and it would just overall like on the Patriots side Brady didn't have to do that much because literally the running backs handled it all like it was it was pretty crazy. Like how once again the running game was like that dominant when you're thinking about the team like the Patriots and you thinking about the goat Tom Brady, but him not having Having to take over the game as much as people would think that you would have to rely on him. It was pretty interesting how I'm Sonia Michelle and James White and and Birkhead ended up like like really pulling the load during that game, but it was going back and forth for what I could see because the chief run again with no slouch either but again, like the costly penalty will see he said I think that with Eric very he wanted up doing that one. That was a really really crucial play and then just the fact that the the pages when the coin I mean, what do you say? I mean, we already talked about we joke about you know, giving Tom Brady too much time any time like this under freaking two minutes is like, you know too much for him. But you you know, you win the coin toss and then like just went in that fashion like I mean, what else can you say? I mean, you can't really be super upset because I mean that's just that's just the luck of the draw because if you really want to finish some you should have tried to finish them before it even got to that point but it is what it is. I do agree. That I never really liked the NFL's ruled for over time. I would like for both teams to get a chance, but that's just the way that",

You got to between the Rams and the Saints which whoo, boy, there's a lot of controversy behind that one and then the Chiefs and the Patriots before we get to the smoke and everything like that because jg's been handing them out all this week. Let's go ahead and start going into the NFL conference championships for the Patriots and the Chiefs now, I'll go with you. First Ziggy what you think of that game? And did you think Man pages had it from the jump or what would you think babe? I mean, I had a feeling the pictures win. I want to the Chiefs win. We talked about, you know, we made a mistake that the Patriots beat them. The first time I thought being at home was going to be the difference and they don't look like it would have been the difference but there was a lot of key mistakes of the chiefs made and we all we all knew from the beginning of the year that if the chiefs were going to go farther defense or it was going to have to play better and the defense was still ferocious and it was not even more magnified because I don't know what this did was thinking lining up in the neutral zone that killed them at the end of the game to make it to where it was pretty much essentially. I think that's what made it to where the tide right? Yeah. Well they went to overtime and you can you gave because you gave Tom Brady to and a hat over two and a half minutes The Comeback because the chiefs were winning in the fourth quarter that she's had to score 24 points in the fourth quarter. After going the first half score list and then you give took Tom Brady even though he's a little baby you give Tom Brady 30 seconds or more. That's all he needs to be able to drive it down the field no matter who is Personnel is I would say 35 seconds or more because he actually had 32 that wants to yeah instruments and laws, and that's true. I mean favorite and only no no, I knew I knew I knew and and way too quick. Way to quake and I yeah, I had a feeling that was gonna happen. But the thing that was really that that play I was talking about the was when he lined up and it was a was a five-year plan to give him the first down whatever it was and that that killed that killed them they really did but um, but I was a very entertaining game and I was hoping that she can pull it off but you know, we could talk about that.

    "doc": "All right, gang check check one two check check check one two. All right gang. We are live. We are back here on the soapbox. This is episode. I think 11 or 12, which is pretty awesome. And I'm actually in a hotel traveling around for a CrossFit level 2 seminar. It was a super busy week, so I didn't get to record in Normal Abode, but I wanted to bring my stuff along with me and chat about some stuff. So. Last podcast we had I was with Paul Tremblay. We had a lot of good feedback on just barrier to entry that type of stuff. So really appreciate that on Buried entry to and across it affiliate this week. I'd like to switch gears a little bit and talk nutrition nutrition is it's a topic that most people don't like to talk about because it's kind of like religion and politics it brings up so much emotion, and it's really what I want to kind of talk about. That helped me a little back story on me and my life when it comes to nutrition. When I found CrossFit. I found CrossFit Journal issue 21, and with that I read the article which explains the zone and and then from there. I followed the zone to a tee. I weighed and measured food that I was just naturally eating sandwiches. So on and so forth that changed my life. It was unbelievable. my relationship with food changed so much after that and I quickly learned about quality of food because I could eat more of it. So when I was owning, you know, just normal food that I was eating. I learned that okay, well favorable unfavorable carbohydrates and as it was written in the in the in the cross of journalists, you're 21 at the time. It was super simple. It's like, all right. Well, are you have bread right a half a slice of bread is a block of carbohydrates. So if I have a sandwich that's four blocks carbohydrate. So why not just get rid of the bread and eat more fruits and vegetables and other things because I want to More food and that was my natural progression essentially into you know, you know, you could consider it paleo. I would almost consider it more like a you know, whole Natural Foods like we talked about the level on meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch and sugar and the reason why it's not you know, I don't know if I actually ever truly prescribed to the paleo diet the paleo diet, you know omission of grains Dairy and legumes and very very restrictive depending on the practitioner that you're thirstier you're learning from but the reality is whole natural foods naturally occurring absolutely having less processed and refined carbohydrates check and that really did change my life and I weighed and measured my food for about five years straight and never cheating. And for those of you that were around me at that time know that and I changed my life and I recommend everyone to do the Zone because of my experience and I know that seems like what does that mean? Well, I learned about food I learned about a relationship with food. I understood macro nutrients better protein carbohydrates and fats. I learned how to turn my body into a laboratory. It was super easy because it was a block system and it wasn't super complex. It wasn't super minut in the details and into what some of the stuff we're seeing nowadays now. I'm not saying the zone is the diet that works for everybody. I'm just saying it taught me something and I now use it and I use that. Base knowledge for everything that I do from a nutritional perspective. Can you go through that learning process without it? Of course, but coming from someone like myself who really had no scope or understanding but a goal it really helped me. So I definitely recommend it if you want to start to learn and go down that Journey but you know, is it hard? Yeah. Well crossfit's hard and we still do it because we know that hard work gets results. So yeah, you got to do a little more than nothing, but I don't think that's an excuse and you know if we're looking for that. Type of hey, like I just need I don't want to work hard, but I want to see results. You know, I understand nutrition is different than Fitness, but at some level it's like all right. Well, if you want to do 20% of what would be 100% effective you're going to get 20% of the results, which means you won't get as much results and you won't get there as faster, which is okay as long as you're aware of that but just be aware of that right? Well variance functionality and intensity isn't variance functionality and low in density is high intensity. And that intensity gets results. So if you go at low or moderate intensity, you'll get lower moderate results. No different with nutrition. So with that said what what I don't want to talk about is preached about a type of diet I want I want to talk about is I think a problem and infestation that we have in the nutritional world nowadays and I think it's a narrative. That is It's upsetting because I don't think anyone wants to do it. I just think it's how people We'll think it should be done. I don't think at the heart people are have mal-intent everything people have care and I've talked about this a lot. So what I mean by that is alright when someone is talking about a nutritional regiment or type of way to eat or whatever. It might be. what has been creeping into a lot of presentations creeping into a lot of narrative out there is eat this way because the other ways are stupid eat in my way because the other way will kill the environment will you know, kill you whatever it might be so my way or whatever way I'm talking about I'm not going to talk about the health benefits of then how about the negative effects of the other ways so essentially vilifying other types of Foods nutritional programs diets. What have you over highlighting the benefits of whatever style of nutrition we're talking about and I really think this is a problem because I don't think we should be doing that type of stuff. So for example, right take the the vegetarian or vegan. World because it's a world that I think is very interesting. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I have a lot of friends that are I know a lot of people that are I know a lot of people that were registering for 20-30 years and have changed and I've spoken to some of the most educated people in the world, which is not me on this topic and it's interesting because putting everything aside I do notice that a lot of the you know, why do I eat this way? Well, and unfortunately I've been I've heard this I've seen it's like well, I don't eat meat or I'm a vegan because of what meat does to you or what these other thing? It's a very negative based as opposed to what I would really love to hear from specifically that Community but others is what are the benefits of a plant-based diet. That's what I want to hear. I don't want to hear the negatives of other diets. I want to hear the Fitz of that diet which I know there are benefits and their office also shortcomings and yeah, let's not also as every there's no perfect fit right the fact that we think that one size fits on everyone should do something is ridiculous. So like there's always pros and cons but it's got to work for you. Right? So what is the narrative that I want changing guys? This can be a simple Concept in a simple episode is Art.

It was a super busy week, so I didn't get to record in Normal Abode, but I wanted to bring my stuff along with me and chat about some stuff. So. Last podcast we had I was with Paul Tremblay. We had a lot of good feedback on just barrier to entry that type of stuff. So really appreciate that on Buried entry to and across it affiliate this week. I'd like to switch gears a little bit and talk nutrition nutrition is it's a topic that most people don't like to talk about because it's kind of like religion and politics it brings up so much emotion, and it's really what I want to kind of talk about. That helped me a little back story on me and my life when it comes to nutrition. When I found CrossFit. I found CrossFit Journal issue 21, and with that I read the article which explains the zone and and then from there. I followed the zone to a tee. I weighed and measured food that I was just naturally eating sandwiches. So on and so forth that changed my life. It was unbelievable. my relationship with food changed so much after that and I quickly learned about quality of food because I could eat more of it. So when I was owning, you know, just normal food that I was eating. I learned that okay, well favorable unfavorable carbohydrates and as it was written in the in the in the cross of journalists, you're 21 at the time. It was super simple. It's like, all right. Well, are you have bread right a half a slice of bread is a block of carbohydrates. So if I have a sandwich that's four blocks carbohydrate. So why not just get rid of the bread and eat more fruits and vegetables and other things because I want to More food and that was my natural progression essentially into you know, you know, you could consider it paleo. I would almost consider it more like a you know, whole Natural Foods like we talked about the level on meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch and sugar and the reason why it's not you know, I don't know if I actually ever truly prescribed to the paleo diet the paleo diet, you know omission of grains Dairy and legumes and very very restrictive depending on the practitioner that you're thirstier you're learning from but the reality is whole natural foods naturally occurring absolutely having less processed and refined carbohydrates check and that really did change my life and I weighed and measured my food for about five years straight and never cheating. And for those of you that were around me at that time know that and I changed my life and I recommend everyone to do the Zone because of my experience and I know that seems like what does that mean? Well, I learned about food I learned about a relationship with food. I understood macro nutrients better protein carbohydrates and fats. I learned how to turn my body into a laboratory. It was super easy because it was a block system and it wasn't super complex. It wasn't super minut in the details and into what some of the stuff we're seeing nowadays now. I'm not saying the zone is the diet that works for everybody. I'm just saying it taught me something and I now use it and I use that. Base knowledge for everything that I do from a nutritional perspective. Can you go through that learning process without it? Of course, but coming from someone like myself who really had no scope or understanding but a goal it really helped me. So I definitely recommend it if you want to start to learn and go down that Journey but you know, is it hard? Yeah. Well crossfit's hard and we still do it because we know that hard work gets results. So yeah, you got to do a little more than nothing, but I don't think that's an excuse and you know if we're looking for that.

I would almost consider it more like a you know, whole Natural Foods like we talked about the level on meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch and sugar and the reason why it's not you know, I don't know if I actually ever truly prescribed to the paleo diet the paleo diet, you know omission of grains Dairy and legumes and very very restrictive depending on the practitioner that you're thirstier you're learning from but the reality is whole natural foods naturally occurring absolutely having less processed and refined carbohydrates check and that really did change my life and I weighed and measured my food for about five years straight and never cheating. And for those of you that were around me at that time know that and I changed my life and I recommend everyone to do the Zone because of my experience and I know that seems like what does that mean? Well, I learned about food I learned about a relationship with food. I understood macro nutrients better protein carbohydrates and fats. I learned how to turn my body into a laboratory. It was super easy because it was a block system and it wasn't super complex. It wasn't super minut in the details and into what some of the stuff we're seeing nowadays now. I'm not saying the zone is the diet that works for everybody. I'm just saying it taught me something and I now use it and I use that. Base knowledge for everything that I do from a nutritional perspective. Can you go through that learning process without it? Of course, but coming from someone like myself who really had no scope or understanding but a goal it really helped me. So I definitely recommend it if you want to start to learn and go down that Journey but you know, is it hard? Yeah. Well crossfit's hard and we still do it because we know that hard work gets results. So yeah, you got to do a little more than nothing, but I don't think that's an excuse and you know if we're looking for that. Type of hey, like I just need I don't want to work hard, but I want to see results. You know, I understand nutrition is different than Fitness, but at some level it's like all right. Well, if you want to do 20% of what would be 100% effective you're going to get 20% of the results, which means you won't get as much results and you won't get there as faster, which is okay as long as you're aware of that but just be aware of that right? Well variance functionality and intensity isn't variance functionality and low in density is high intensity. And that intensity gets results. So if you go at low or moderate intensity, you'll get lower moderate results. No different with nutrition. So with that said what what I don't want to talk about is preached about a type of diet I want I want to talk about is I think a problem and infestation that we have in the nutritional world nowadays and I think it's a narrative. That is It's upsetting because I don't think anyone wants to do it. I just think it's how people We'll think it should be done. I don't think at the heart people are have mal-intent everything people have care and I've talked about this a lot. So what I mean by that is alright when someone is talking about a nutritional regiment or type of way to eat or whatever. It might be. what has been creeping into a lot of presentations creeping into a lot of narrative out there is eat this way because the other ways are stupid eat in my way because the other way will kill the environment will you know, kill you whatever it might be so my way or whatever way I'm talking about I'm not going to talk about the health benefits of then how about the negative effects of the other ways so essentially vilifying other types of Foods nutritional programs diets. What have you over highlighting the benefits of whatever style of nutrition we're talking about and I really think this is a problem because I don't think we should be doing that type of stuff. So for example, right take the the vegetarian or vegan. World because it's a world that I think is very interesting. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I have a lot of friends that are I know a lot of people that are I know a lot of people that were registering for 20-30 years and have changed and I've spoken to some of the most educated people in the world, which is not me on this topic and it's interesting because putting everything aside I do notice that a lot of the you know, why do I eat this way? Well, and unfortunately I've been I've heard this I've seen it's like well, I don't eat meat or I'm a vegan because of what meat does to you or what these other thing? It's a very negative based as opposed to what I would really love to hear from specifically that Community but others is what are the benefits of a plant-based diet. That's what I want to hear. I don't want to hear the negatives of other diets. I want to hear the Fitz of that diet which I know there are benefits and their office also shortcomings and yeah, let's not also as every there's no perfect fit right the fact that we think that one size fits on everyone should do something is ridiculous. So like there's always pros and cons but it's got to work for you. Right? So what is the narrative that I want changing guys? This can be a simple Concept in a simple episode is Art. What are the benefits of eating a plant-based diet? Diet, you know the micro nutrient content the fiber the you know, the real foods, whatever it might be like, you know what it can do for gut health, whatever. I want to hear. I want to see it. That's what I want to know. So if like hey guys, I want to bring awareness about this type of nutrition program because I'm passionate about it. I like it. It's something that I enjoy great. Tell me what's good about it. What I would rather not hear is what's negative. And so then I did some self-reflection talking to people. It's like, all right.

    "doc": "All right, gang check check one two check check check one two. All right gang. We are live. We are back here on the soapbox. This is episode. I think 11 or 12, which is pretty awesome. And I'm actually in a hotel traveling around for a CrossFit level 2 seminar. It was a super busy week, so I didn't get to record in Normal Abode, but I wanted to bring my stuff along with me and chat about some stuff. So. Last podcast we had I was with Paul Tremblay. We had a lot of good feedback on just barrier to entry that type of stuff. So really appreciate that on Buried entry to and across it affiliate this week. I'd like to switch gears a little bit and talk nutrition nutrition is it's a topic that most people don't like to talk about because it's kind of like religion and politics it brings up so much emotion, and it's really what I want to kind of talk about. That helped me a little back story on me and my life when it comes to nutrition. When I found CrossFit. I found CrossFit Journal issue 21, and with that I read the article which explains the zone and and then from there. I followed the zone to a tee. I weighed and measured food that I was just naturally eating sandwiches. So on and so forth that changed my life. It was unbelievable. my relationship with food changed so much after that and I quickly learned about quality of food because I could eat more of it. So when I was owning, you know, just normal food that I was eating. I learned that okay, well favorable unfavorable carbohydrates and as it was written in the in the in the cross of journalists, you're 21 at the time. It was super simple. It's like, all right. Well, are you have bread right a half a slice of bread is a block of carbohydrates. So if I have a sandwich that's four blocks carbohydrate. So why not just get rid of the bread and eat more fruits and vegetables and other things because I want to More food and that was my natural progression essentially into you know, you know, you could consider it paleo. I would almost consider it more like a you know, whole Natural Foods like we talked about the level on meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch and sugar and the reason why it's not you know, I don't know if I actually ever truly prescribed to the paleo diet the paleo diet, you know omission of grains Dairy and legumes and very very restrictive depending on the practitioner that you're thirstier you're learning from but the reality is whole natural foods naturally occurring absolutely having less processed and refined carbohydrates check and that really did change my life and I weighed and measured my food for about five years straight and never cheating. And for those of you that were around me at that time know that and I changed my life and I recommend everyone to do the Zone because of my experience and I know that seems like what does that mean? Well, I learned about food I learned about a relationship with food. I understood macro nutrients better protein carbohydrates and fats. I learned how to turn my body into a laboratory. It was super easy because it was a block system and it wasn't super complex. It wasn't super minut in the details and into what some of the stuff we're seeing nowadays now. I'm not saying the zone is the diet that works for everybody. I'm just saying it taught me something and I now use it and I use that. Base knowledge for everything that I do from a nutritional perspective. Can you go through that learning process without it? Of course, but coming from someone like myself who really had no scope or understanding but a goal it really helped me. So I definitely recommend it if you want to start to learn and go down that Journey but you know, is it hard? Yeah. Well crossfit's hard and we still do it because we know that hard work gets results. So yeah, you got to do a little more than nothing, but I don't think that's an excuse and you know if we're looking for that. Type of hey, like I just need I don't want to work hard, but I want to see results. You know, I understand nutrition is different than Fitness, but at some level it's like all right. Well, if you want to do 20% of what would be 100% effective you're going to get 20% of the results, which means you won't get as much results and you won't get there as faster, which is okay as long as you're aware of that but just be aware of that right? Well variance functionality and intensity isn't variance functionality and low in density is high intensity. And that intensity gets results. So if you go at low or moderate intensity, you'll get lower moderate results. No different with nutrition. So with that said what what I don't want to talk about is preached about a type of diet I want I want to talk about is I think a problem and infestation that we have in the nutritional world nowadays and I think it's a narrative. That is It's upsetting because I don't think anyone wants to do it. I just think it's how people We'll think it should be done. I don't think at the heart people are have mal-intent everything people have care and I've talked about this a lot. So what I mean by that is alright when someone is talking about a nutritional regiment or type of way to eat or whatever. It might be. what has been creeping into a lot of presentations creeping into a lot of narrative out there is eat this way because the other ways are stupid eat in my way because the other way will kill the environment will you know, kill you whatever it might be so my way or whatever way I'm talking about I'm not going to talk about the health benefits of then how about the negative effects of the other ways so essentially vilifying other types of Foods nutritional programs diets. What have you over highlighting the benefits of whatever style of nutrition we're talking about and I really think this is a problem because I don't think we should be doing that type of stuff. So for example, right take the the vegetarian or vegan. World because it's a world that I think is very interesting. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I have a lot of friends that are I know a lot of people that are I know a lot of people that were registering for 20-30 years and have changed and I've spoken to some of the most educated people in the world, which is not me on this topic and it's interesting because putting everything aside I do notice that a lot of the you know, why do I eat this way? Well, and unfortunately I've been I've heard this I've seen it's like well, I don't eat meat or I'm a vegan because of what meat does to you or what these other thing? It's a very negative based as opposed to what I would really love to hear from specifically that Community but others is what are the benefits of a plant-based diet. That's what I want to hear. I don't want to hear the negatives of other diets. I want to hear the Fitz of that diet which I know there are benefits and their office also shortcomings and yeah, let's not also as every there's no perfect fit right the fact that we think that one size fits on everyone should do something is ridiculous. So like there's always pros and cons but it's got to work for you. Right? So what is the narrative that I want changing guys? This can be a simple Concept in a simple episode is Art. What are the benefits of eating a plant-based diet? Diet, you know the micro nutrient content the fiber the you know, the real foods, whatever it might be like, you know what it can do for gut health, whatever. I want to hear. I want to see it. That's what I want to know. So if like hey guys, I want to bring awareness about this type of nutrition program because I'm passionate about it. I like it. It's something that I enjoy great. Tell me what's good about it. What I would rather not hear is what's negative. And so then I did some self-reflection talking to people. It's like, all right. Well, how how I- about other things and I think",

You're doing a lot of stuff was happening. What are you? What are you up to at the moment? I know we just came back from Christmas. But what is your Our plan was all things the project stuff. Are you doing a moment? Right? So yeah been based in Germany. Yeah with my brother's out there. Ozm ik do nothing. And with that being said, it's things like a lot of content creation like on the Instagram. We're doing a lot just finished filming a movie out there a dance movie that's going to come out this summer. I guess if everything works out fine done a tour of an eye. Is quite a big heart is in Germany shower. Ricky needs to be a fox all these guys. Yeah more so moving in these type of areas. Also still training my freestyle. Yeah pop like feet. Yeah also hit a few battles abroad night fucking styles. That's what you're going to do this year. No, I'm not fucking Styles and some other ones that are conferring of right now. Yeah, so is that like East kind of keeping the same sort of plan like building on these projects or do you have new things coming up or yeah. So right now it's like these projects that we've done last year kind of longer-term. Like for example, the tool we did with the our is we're going to be doing some more festivals and some more music videos with them trying to grow as a collective. Yeah. So and in terms of with things like light feet and stuffs just keep training trying to build more delightful Community for example in Germany. And with the acting I was I don't know what opportunities will come from that once the movie is out. You definitely would love to do more acting. Yeah, tell us about the movie. So what was the whole deal with that? How did that come about because wait, let's get the car back first of all, so you were born where I was born in Germany. Okay. Yes. Then you were I met you was in Watford in Watford. That's right. And when did you move too often? We move to Watford in 2009. Yes. Oh, yeah. I must have been like 10 or something like that around the age 10 or 11. Yeah move to what food my parents but not with Isaac not with either Caprice. They were old enough to stay in Berlin. Okay. Yeah, I was the youngest so yeah because I didn't I met obviously your older brother first and he came to Watford. I don't know at what point but he came for a year, right? Yeah, okay, and then those aren't even 12 or 11. I think yeah, we saw him at a battle in Trocadero and he just came up to most I think I was like hey, bro, you live in Watford. And then yeah next thing. I know they brought him to training and then he became friends and then it was actually only after he left that mean you became friends with it. You like stayed and hang out with us and train but I think you also quite Young when Isaac was here. We're definitely must have been like what 14 something. Yeah. Yeah he 15. So yeah, we move to Watford. Yeah. 2009 be living in what forever since I've done my studies and whatnot here in England is all and then yeah during that time Isaac a met you guys I wasn't really I was dancing back in Germany still. Yeah, but it wasn't like taking to it yet. Like I love dancing. I was going it was that what I wanted to do was all kind of thing but not until like I hit like 15, that's what I really took on the Journey of wanted to get better trying to Excel and you know that type of thing. That's that's when I started getting closer to you guys as well because I knew you and what food is around the corner. Yeah, and we were also super dope. That's what you mean. Yeah. He's like, yeah. The reason I can I hang out with you guys because it's again it's convenient. I really would have loved to train with someone else but you know you guys around yeah, I didn't have to take the underground together know obviously I'm playing. Yeah, so then okay, so then obviously a stayed in Watford we've done loads of stuff together and whatever and you've done your own stuff here, but when You how long have you been back in Berlin now for good? I moved back to Berlin last year. Okay. Yeah, like kind of this time last year or it's January 2020. But yeah, I'd say about not say about like march-may times maybe a thing. Okay. Yeah, so maybe like just under a year you mean? Yeah, maybe just on the okay, but I've been back and forth as well more times just back and forth but mainly staying in Germany. Yes. I it's like yeah you always a bit people see me as your family still here. Yeah, come here come here and see them and then you're back in Germany in your own place. Yeah, so then all right. So, how did it go from? Okay, I'm 15 and I want to start dancing and now you are like in a movie. Where did that come from? Well sabzi come from the back the battle scene. Yeah, just in the battle scene. I feel that teachers feel like teaches you a lot teaches you a lot of discipline any way to like kind of bail yourself and that also kind of transfers onto life is also when it was from training every day. I realize okay. I need to do my studies as well if I want to have like a bigger plan or have that. A backup or not? Yeah, so I feel like it was a lot of trading a lot of training connections meeting people, you know, they kind of happened organically happen. Organically, I'd say it wasn't like, oh, I got an agent and the agent like booked me for this movie or something like that. You know, it's not just like they found you from yeah. Like I have a friend out in Germany called Pepita. She's a choreographer. Okay. Yeah, and she we've done a job before that. I think the month before two months before that and yeah, we connected really well. I liked her so she liked my stuff and then she was she's the choreographer of the movie. So she suggested me to the director the director real Acme went for the audition. And when she suggested you it was for the role that you eventually got or none of what I went to this evil was the main role. I didn't get the main role. Okay, because I was like to like the main rule is meant to be like 1560 in the movie and I'm actually yeah, how tall are you by the way? The people that you're sitting down, okay. Yeah, you've been hitting the gym obviously not much everybody. Yeah. Yeah, but I know that you can't play 15 anymore. Yeah. So yeah, and then they gave me a number of their said I would perfectly fit into that's like yeah pretty cool row. I felt I didn't it didn't feel alien to me. You know, what was wrong? Basically we I'ma Do we could Joe and pepper pepper. We're powdered Street and seen we Really know the street that scene and the main role is also in the street then seen these kind of power over click, but then again, he's not he's got he's in his own world, but he's just always around that type of thing. I don't know if that makes sense. My life's a way street dance click. Yeah, Joan pepper like the leaders of the street and click and we have Marlin and he's just always in the room for example, but he's not really with us all the time. But uh if they're kind of you know, so that's that's kind of the role that I play and And you've never done any acting before this no and they knew that. Yeah, and like when you went to do the audition shit, did you have to act like or was it more like dance and then we'll do the rest of it was like no doing acting scene and you are we started with the acting scene.

Yeah, so is that like East kind of keeping the same sort of plan like building on these projects or do you have new things coming up or yeah. So right now it's like these projects that we've done last year kind of longer-term. Like for example, the tool we did with the our is we're going to be doing some more festivals and some more music videos with them trying to grow as a collective. Yeah. So and in terms of with things like light feet and stuffs just keep training trying to build more delightful Community for example in Germany. And with the acting I was I don't know what opportunities will come from that once the movie is out. You definitely would love to do more acting. Yeah, tell us about the movie. So what was the whole deal with that? How did that come about because wait, let's get the car back first of all, so you were born where I was born in Germany. Okay. Yes. Then you were I met you was in Watford in Watford. That's right. And when did you move too often? We move to Watford in 2009. Yes. Oh, yeah. I must have been like 10 or something like that around the age 10 or 11. Yeah move to what food my parents but not with Isaac not with either Caprice. They were old enough to stay in Berlin. Okay. Yeah, I was the youngest so yeah because I didn't I met obviously your older brother first and he came to Watford. I don't know at what point but he came for a year, right? Yeah, okay, and then those aren't even 12 or 11. I think yeah, we saw him at a battle in Trocadero and he just came up to most I think I was like hey, bro, you live in Watford. And then yeah next thing. I know they brought him to training and then he became friends and then it was actually only after he left that mean you became friends with it. You like stayed and hang out with us and train but I think you also quite Young when Isaac was here. We're definitely must have been like what 14 something. Yeah. Yeah he 15. So yeah, we move to Watford. Yeah. 2009 be living in what forever since I've done my studies and whatnot here in England is all and then yeah during that time Isaac a met you guys I wasn't really I was dancing back in Germany still. Yeah, but it wasn't like taking to it yet. Like I love dancing. I was going it was that what I wanted to do was all kind of thing but not until like I hit like 15, that's what I really took on the Journey of wanted to get better trying to Excel and you know that type of thing. That's that's when I started getting closer to you guys as well because I knew you and what food is around the corner. Yeah, and we were also super dope. That's what you mean. Yeah. He's like, yeah. The reason I can I hang out with you guys because it's again it's convenient. I really would have loved to train with someone else but you know you guys around yeah, I didn't have to take the underground together know obviously I'm playing. Yeah, so then okay, so then obviously a stayed in Watford we've done loads of stuff together and whatever and you've done your own stuff here, but when You how long have you been back in Berlin now for good? I moved back to Berlin last year. Okay. Yeah, like kind of this time last year or it's January 2020. But yeah, I'd say about not say about like march-may times maybe a thing. Okay. Yeah, so maybe like just under a year you mean? Yeah, maybe just on the okay, but I've been back and forth as well more times just back and forth but mainly staying in Germany. Yes. I it's like yeah you always a bit people see me as your family still here. Yeah, come here come here and see them and then you're back in Germany in your own place. Yeah, so then all right. So, how did it go from? Okay, I'm 15 and I want to start dancing and now you are like in a movie. Where did that come from? Well sabzi come from the back the battle scene. Yeah, just in the battle scene. I feel that teachers feel like teaches you a lot teaches you a lot of discipline any way to like kind of bail yourself and that also kind of transfers onto life is also when it was from training every day. I realize okay. I need to do my studies as well if I want to have like a bigger plan or have that. A backup or not? Yeah, so I feel like it was a lot of trading a lot of training connections meeting people, you know, they kind of happened organically happen. Organically, I'd say it wasn't like, oh, I got an agent and the agent like booked me for this movie or something like that. You know, it's not just like they found you from yeah. Like I have a friend out in Germany called Pepita. She's a choreographer. Okay. Yeah, and she we've done a job before that. I think the month before two months before that and yeah, we connected really well. I liked her so she liked my stuff and then she was she's the choreographer of the movie. So she suggested me to the director the director real Acme went for the audition. And when she suggested you it was for the role that you eventually got or none of what I went to this evil was the main role. I didn't get the main role. Okay, because I was like to like the main rule is meant to be like 1560 in the movie and I'm actually yeah, how tall are you by the way? The people that you're sitting down, okay. Yeah, you've been hitting the gym obviously not much everybody. Yeah. Yeah, but I know that you can't play 15 anymore. Yeah. So yeah, and then they gave me a number of their said I would perfectly fit into that's like yeah pretty cool row. I felt I didn't it didn't feel alien to me. You know, what was wrong? Basically we I'ma Do we could Joe and pepper pepper. We're powdered Street and seen we Really know the street that scene and the main role is also in the street then seen these kind of power over click, but then again, he's not he's got he's in his own world, but he's just always around that type of thing. I don't know if that makes sense. My life's a way street dance click. Yeah, Joan pepper like the leaders of the street and click and we have Marlin and he's just always in the room for example, but he's not really with us all the time. But uh if they're kind of you know, so that's that's kind of the role that I play and And you've never done any acting before this no and they knew that. Yeah, and like when you went to do the audition shit, did you have to act like or was it more like dance and then we'll do the rest of it was like no doing acting scene and you are we started with the acting scene. Okay, which I feel like I messed up a lot",

So I have been using anchor for quite some time now and I have to say this is the best app. I decided to download it is free of use and it's very simple which I love. Okay. So if you're trying to open a podcast and you don't know where to start or how to start I highly recommend anchor okay, you can also make some side money on this as They send you sponsorship and one not so I highly recommend this app. All right. Now you guys enjoy my podcast for the day have a good one. What's going on told my beautiful listeners on my podcast. I would like to make this episode dedicated to the ego because I just think a lot of people don't understand the eagle and what is all about? Okay, I think some people kind of get it but at the same time You know, I guess because so many people's brain are using the left hemisphere is kind of like it can kind of like fog the broader perspective of of what the ego is all about. Now this three reality this this Matrix, you know right now every what we are experiencing right now. Okay, from what we came out of our mother's womb. Umm to when we leave the physical. This is all ego base. Okay. So this entire room is revolving around ego. All right, we are in the 3D Matrix. We are in the third dimensional density. All right or fear. Okay. We are experiencing this 3D realm in the 3D sphere. All right. so, you know when people in the spiritual Community or real individuals that are doing the spiritual work, you know, they're going to constantly talk about the ego because this is something we really have to become aware of on the 3D Matrix because if we don't become aware of our ego is going to consume us and we're going to start operating from it on a very very very very very extreme rate and that is To call the false self. Okay, so when people operate from their ego on an extreme rate and their detached from who they truly are their authentic being, you know, they're not going to even recognize that they're operating from a false self. And this is why a lot of people have issues with projecting self-reflecting introspecting taking accountability things in that nature because they're operating from their false self and an Same rate. They're very very very very detached from the true self. That is you know, the buried within your being. Okay, the body system is just the mobile. You are not the body you are the soul. The body is just something you're using until you leave when you leave your physical flesh. You're not taking your body with you. Okay, and this is the whole thing where reincarnation if people are not aware of themselves and people are just Doing a lot of toxic shit to each other and and it's sad because there I don't think some people are even capable of acknowledging their own toxic traits because they're operating from the false self. So extremely that they think is normal they think is okay and they just start justifying those things. Like they don't know how to self-reflect. They don't know how to acknowledge like wow. I've been doing this all my life, but I didn't realize how toxic it was to me or others. Some people don't know how to do that and it's a sad reality. But now the twist to this is that people think they know how to take accountability. They think they know who they truly are and they think they know like how to tune in keyword think and that's because many people are trapped in the mind. You know what I'm saying? They they But everything that they are experiencing in the 3D realm there, they're stuck in the mind and they're not really truly embodying the things that they're thinking or saying out of their mouths. You understand what I'm saying? They're not embodying it and this is why so many people don't you know, they don't know how to back up their words what action it's a sad reality. All right, A lot of people are stuck in their head. Ed and detach from the body, you know, they you know, they forgot to to I guess it's not that they've they have blockages from embodying the things that are coming out of their mouth. All right now like I mentioned the Eagles not gonna die if you want to kill the eagle, you have to kill yourself. There's no other way around it. Okay, but when spiritual people say, oh kill the ego they're just talking about become aware of the fucking shit. That's really what they're trying to say. Okay. You know, if you kill the ego your you have to kill yourself because then that means you have to leave your body every matter on this physical is ego-based every materialistic thing. All right, even when we speak every time we express ourselves every time we think okay, all of that is Eagle base. You understand what I'm saying? Even when you take action all of that is ego-based, but of course You know, some people have unwell a lot of people actually not some they have unhealthy Eagles. Okay, where's to extreme and they're stuck on their head and you know what I'm saying? They're in prison to their head and their detached from embodying whatever the hell they thinking or whatever the hell they're saying and these are people that are operating from their false self, you know, and it's a sad reality, you know, you know, you can when you speak to people you can see the Ego versus the true self, you know, you can see the difference. You see what I'm saying? But at the same time when you have unhealthy ego you realize like okay, you know, it's still a part of me. So I'm going to have to utilize this in a proper manner. Where is not consuming me too much where I'm operating from a false self a false identity, you know, you know how many people are operating from a delusional? No mindset, it's a lot and and you know, this is the 3D Matrix, you know, everything that is created here on this physical came from a thought. You see what I'm saying? So everything came out of nothing so all of the stuff that that we give matter to his only important because we created that reality and are self-conscious but there's no importance and the majority of the shit on the 3D Matrix not even your body. It's a reality, okay. There is important from the ego the all these things are important from the eagle. So when you have a healthy ego you learn how to you know, do things that is good for your physical body. Go to the gym. He healthy, you know, all those things work out, you know, go ahead and on the physical, you know, do what you need to do. Make your personal life better for your for yourself because we're all individuals. We are we all here for a different purpose. So what I'm here and the vision I have on this physical is different from one of the person because we all lived through different mental Dimension. And I think people forget that, you know, people are very one-track minded but you know, you just cannot escape the ego but at the same time you have to utilize it properly like I mentioned, you know what I'm saying? You have to know because the ego is basically, you know, what you're going to what you're going to utilize the most on the 3D Matrix. Okay, because this is the realm of the ego but not the problem is a lot of people are too detached from their true self their true nature and they're operating from it on an extreme rate. And this is the cause of blockages. Okay, people also tend to be very very You know, they told you one thing but then their action tells you another and that's because the false self is doing that you understand what I'm saying? But you cannot blame these people, you know, it's just the way the body system is like a machine and it's just the way these people are operating on the physical and how self-aware they are of their body which is like a computer system. How aware they are of it. Okay, you are the only one that could uh, you know, decode and recode and and reprogram yourself. Subconscious nobody else can do that. But now if you live heavily from",

Okay, so when people operate from their ego on an extreme rate and their detached from who they truly are their authentic being, you know, they're not going to even recognize that they're operating from a false self. And this is why a lot of people have issues with projecting self-reflecting introspecting taking accountability things in that nature because they're operating from their false self and an Same rate. They're very very very very detached from the true self. That is you know, the buried within your being. Okay, the body system is just the mobile. You are not the body you are the soul. The body is just something you're using until you leave when you leave your physical flesh. You're not taking your body with you. Okay, and this is the whole thing where reincarnation if people are not aware of themselves and people are just Doing a lot of toxic shit to each other and and it's sad because there I don't think some people are even capable of acknowledging their own toxic traits because they're operating from the false self. So extremely that they think is normal they think is okay and they just start justifying those things. Like they don't know how to self-reflect. They don't know how to acknowledge like wow. I've been doing this all my life, but I didn't realize how toxic it was to me or others. Some people don't know how to do that and it's a sad reality. But now the twist to this is that people think they know how to take accountability. They think they know who they truly are and they think they know like how to tune in keyword think and that's because many people are trapped in the mind. You know what I'm saying? They they But everything that they are experiencing in the 3D realm there, they're stuck in the mind and they're not really truly embodying the things that they're thinking or saying out of their mouths. You understand what I'm saying? They're not embodying it and this is why so many people don't you know, they don't know how to back up their words what action it's a sad reality. All right, A lot of people are stuck in their head. Ed and detach from the body, you know, they you know, they forgot to to I guess it's not that they've they have blockages from embodying the things that are coming out of their mouth. All right now like I mentioned the Eagles not gonna die if you want to kill the eagle, you have to kill yourself. There's no other way around it. Okay, but when spiritual people say, oh kill the ego they're just talking about become aware of the fucking shit. That's really what they're trying to say. Okay. You know, if you kill the ego your you have to kill yourself because then that means you have to leave your body every matter on this physical is ego-based every materialistic thing. All right, even when we speak every time we express ourselves every time we think okay, all of that is Eagle base. You understand what I'm saying? Even when you take action all of that is ego-based, but of course You know, some people have unwell a lot of people actually not some they have unhealthy Eagles. Okay, where's to extreme and they're stuck on their head and you know what I'm saying? They're in prison to their head and their detached from embodying whatever the hell they thinking or whatever the hell they're saying and these are people that are operating from their false self, you know, and it's a sad reality, you know, you know, you can when you speak to people you can see the Ego versus the true self, you know, you can see the difference. You see what I'm saying? But at the same time when you have unhealthy ego you realize like okay, you know, it's still a part of me. So I'm going to have to utilize this in a proper manner. Where is not consuming me too much where I'm operating from a false self a false identity, you know, you know how many people are operating from a delusional? No mindset, it's a lot and and you know, this is the 3D Matrix, you know, everything that is created here on this physical came from a thought. You see what I'm saying? So everything came out of nothing so all of the stuff that that we give matter to his only important because we created that reality and are self-conscious but there's no importance and the majority of the shit on the 3D Matrix not even your body. It's a reality, okay. There is important from the ego the all these things are important from the eagle. So when you have a healthy ego you learn how to you know, do things that is good for your physical body. Go to the gym. He healthy, you know, all those things work out, you know, go ahead and on the physical, you know, do what you need to do. Make your personal life better for your for yourself because we're all individuals. We are we all here for a different purpose. So what I'm here and the vision I have on this physical is different from one of the person because we all lived through different mental Dimension. And I think people forget that, you know, people are very one-track minded but you know, you just cannot escape the ego but at the same time you have to utilize it properly like I mentioned, you know what I'm saying? You have to know because the ego is basically, you know, what you're going to what you're going to utilize the most on the 3D Matrix. Okay, because this is the realm of the ego but not the problem is a lot of people are too detached from their true self their true nature and they're operating from it on an extreme rate. And this is the cause of blockages. Okay, people also tend to be very very You know, they told you one thing but then their action tells you another and that's because the false self is doing that you understand what I'm saying? But you cannot blame these people, you know, it's just the way the body system is like a machine and it's just the way these people are operating on the physical and how self-aware they are of their body which is like a computer system.

So I have been using anchor for quite some time now and I have to say this is the best app. I decided to download it is free of use and it's very simple which I love. Okay. So if you're trying to open a podcast and you don't know where to start or how to start I highly recommend anchor okay, you can also make some side money on this as They send you sponsorship and one not so I highly recommend this app. All right. Now you guys enjoy my podcast for the day have a good one. What's going on told my beautiful listeners on my podcast. I would like to make this episode dedicated to the ego because I just think a lot of people don't understand the eagle and what is all about? Okay, I think some people kind of get it but at the same time You know, I guess because so many people's brain are using the left hemisphere is kind of like it can kind of like fog the broader perspective of of what the ego is all about. Now this three reality this this Matrix, you know right now every what we are experiencing right now. Okay, from what we came out of our mother's womb. Umm to when we leave the physical. This is all ego base. Okay. So this entire room is revolving around ego. All right, we are in the 3D Matrix. We are in the third dimensional density. All right or fear. Okay. We are experiencing this 3D realm in the 3D sphere. All right. so, you know when people in the spiritual Community or real individuals that are doing the spiritual work, you know, they're going to constantly talk about the ego because this is something we really have to become aware of on the 3D Matrix because if we don't become aware of our ego is going to consume us and we're going to start operating from it on a very very very very very extreme rate and that is To call the false self. Okay, so when people operate from their ego on an extreme rate and their detached from who they truly are their authentic being, you know, they're not going to even recognize that they're operating from a false self. And this is why a lot of people have issues with projecting self-reflecting introspecting taking accountability things in that nature because they're operating from their false self and an Same rate. They're very very very very detached from the true self. That is you know, the buried within your being. Okay, the body system is just the mobile. You are not the body you are the soul. The body is just something you're using until you leave when you leave your physical flesh. You're not taking your body with you. Okay, and this is the whole thing where reincarnation if people are not aware of themselves and people are just Doing a lot of toxic shit to each other and and it's sad because there I don't think some people are even capable of acknowledging their own toxic traits because they're operating from the false self. So extremely that they think is normal they think is okay and they just start justifying those things. Like they don't know how to self-reflect. They don't know how to acknowledge like wow. I've been doing this all my life, but I didn't realize how toxic it was to me or others. Some people don't know how to do that and it's a sad reality. But now the twist to this is that people think they know how to take accountability. They think they know who they truly are and they think they know like how to tune in keyword think and that's because many people are trapped in the mind. You know what I'm saying? They they But everything that they are experiencing in the 3D realm there, they're stuck in the mind and they're not really truly embodying the things that they're thinking or saying out of their mouths. You understand what I'm saying? They're not embodying it and this is why so many people don't you know, they don't know how to back up their words what action it's a sad reality. All right, A lot of people are stuck in their head. Ed and detach from the body, you know, they you know, they forgot to to I guess it's not that they've they have blockages from embodying the things that are coming out of their mouth. All right now like I mentioned the Eagles not gonna die if you want to kill the eagle, you have to kill yourself. There's no other way around it. Okay, but when spiritual people say, oh kill the ego they're just talking about become aware of the fucking shit. That's really what they're trying to say. Okay. You know, if you kill the ego your you have to kill yourself because then that means you have to leave your body every matter on this physical is ego-based every materialistic thing. All right, even when we speak every time we express ourselves every time we think okay, all of that is Eagle base. You understand what I'm saying? Even when you take action all of that is ego-based, but of course You know, some people have unwell a lot of people actually not some they have unhealthy Eagles. Okay, where's to extreme and they're stuck on their head and you know what I'm saying? They're in prison to their head and their detached from embodying whatever the hell they thinking or whatever the hell they're saying and these are people that are operating from their false self, you know, and it's a sad reality, you know, you know, you can when you speak to people you can see the Ego versus the true self, you know, you can see the difference. You see what I'm saying? But at the same time when you have unhealthy ego you realize like okay, you know, it's still a part of me. So I'm going to have to utilize this in a proper manner. Where is not consuming me too much where I'm operating from a false self a false identity, you know, you know how many people are operating from a delusional? No mindset, it's a lot and and you know, this is the 3D Matrix, you know, everything that is created here on this physical came from a thought. You see what I'm saying? So everything came out of nothing so all of the stuff that that we give matter to his only important because we created that reality and are self-conscious but there's no importance and the majority of the shit on the 3D Matrix not even your body. It's a reality, okay. There is important from the ego the all these things are important from the eagle. So when you have a healthy ego you learn how to you know, do things that is good for your physical body. Go to the gym. He healthy, you know, all those things work out, you know, go ahead and on the physical, you know, do what you need to do.

So what I'm here and the vision I have on this physical is different from one of the person because we all lived through different mental Dimension. And I think people forget that, you know, people are very one-track minded but you know, you just cannot escape the ego but at the same time you have to utilize it properly like I mentioned, you know what I'm saying? You have to know because the ego is basically, you know, what you're going to what you're going to utilize the most on the 3D Matrix. Okay, because this is the realm of the ego but not the problem is a lot of people are too detached from their true self their true nature and they're operating from it on an extreme rate. And this is the cause of blockages. Okay, people also tend to be very very You know, they told you one thing but then their action tells you another and that's because the false self is doing that you understand what I'm saying? But you cannot blame these people, you know, it's just the way the body system is like a machine and it's just the way these people are operating on the physical and how self-aware they are of their body which is like a computer system. How aware they are of it. Okay, you are the only one that could uh, you know, decode and recode and and reprogram yourself. Subconscious nobody else can do that. But now if you live heavily from",

So if you're trying to open a podcast and you don't know where to start or how to start I highly recommend anchor okay, you can also make some side money on this as They send you sponsorship and one not so I highly recommend this app. All right. Now you guys enjoy my podcast for the day have a good one. What's going on told my beautiful listeners on my podcast. I would like to make this episode dedicated to the ego because I just think a lot of people don't understand the eagle and what is all about? Okay, I think some people kind of get it but at the same time You know, I guess because so many people's brain are using the left hemisphere is kind of like it can kind of like fog the broader perspective of of what the ego is all about. Now this three reality this this Matrix, you know right now every what we are experiencing right now. Okay, from what we came out of our mother's womb. Umm to when we leave the physical. This is all ego base. Okay. So this entire room is revolving around ego. All right, we are in the 3D Matrix. We are in the third dimensional density. All right or fear. Okay. We are experiencing this 3D realm in the 3D sphere. All right. so, you know when people in the spiritual Community or real individuals that are doing the spiritual work, you know, they're going to constantly talk about the ego because this is something we really have to become aware of on the 3D Matrix because if we don't become aware of our ego is going to consume us and we're going to start operating from it on a very very very very very extreme rate and that is To call the false self. Okay, so when people operate from their ego on an extreme rate and their detached from who they truly are their authentic being, you know, they're not going to even recognize that they're operating from a false self. And this is why a lot of people have issues with projecting self-reflecting introspecting taking accountability things in that nature because they're operating from their false self and an Same rate. They're very very very very detached from the true self. That is you know, the buried within your being. Okay, the body system is just the mobile. You are not the body you are the soul. The body is just something you're using until you leave when you leave your physical flesh. You're not taking your body with you. Okay, and this is the whole thing where reincarnation if people are not aware of themselves and people are just Doing a lot of toxic shit to each other and and it's sad because there I don't think some people are even capable of acknowledging their own toxic traits because they're operating from the false self. So extremely that they think is normal they think is okay and they just start justifying those things. Like they don't know how to self-reflect. They don't know how to acknowledge like wow. I've been doing this all my life, but I didn't realize how toxic it was to me or others. Some people don't know how to do that and it's a sad reality. But now the twist to this is that people think they know how to take accountability. They think they know who they truly are and they think they know like how to tune in keyword think and that's because many people are trapped in the mind. You know what I'm saying? They they But everything that they are experiencing in the 3D realm there, they're stuck in the mind and they're not really truly embodying the things that they're thinking or saying out of their mouths. You understand what I'm saying? They're not embodying it and this is why so many people don't you know, they don't know how to back up their words what action it's a sad reality. All right, A lot of people are stuck in their head. Ed and detach from the body, you know, they you know, they forgot to to I guess it's not that they've they have blockages from embodying the things that are coming out of their mouth. All right now like I mentioned the Eagles not gonna die if you want to kill the eagle, you have to kill yourself. There's no other way around it. Okay, but when spiritual people say, oh kill the ego they're just talking about become aware of the fucking shit. That's really what they're trying to say. Okay. You know, if you kill the ego your you have to kill yourself because then that means you have to leave your body every matter on this physical is ego-based every materialistic thing. All right, even when we speak every time we express ourselves every time we think okay, all of that is Eagle base. You understand what I'm saying? Even when you take action all of that is ego-based, but of course You know, some people have unwell a lot of people actually not some they have unhealthy Eagles. Okay, where's to extreme and they're stuck on their head and you know what I'm saying? They're in prison to their head and their detached from embodying whatever the hell they thinking or whatever the hell they're saying and these are people that are operating from their false self, you know, and it's a sad reality, you know, you know, you can when you speak to people you can see the Ego versus the true self, you know, you can see the difference. You see what I'm saying? But at the same time when you have unhealthy ego you realize like okay, you know, it's still a part of me. So I'm going to have to utilize this in a proper manner. Where is not consuming me too much where I'm operating from a false self a false identity, you know, you know how many people are operating from a delusional? No mindset, it's a lot and and you know, this is the 3D Matrix, you know, everything that is created here on this physical came from a thought. You see what I'm saying? So everything came out of nothing so all of the stuff that that we give matter to his only important because we created that reality and are self-conscious but there's no importance and the majority of the shit on the 3D Matrix not even your body. It's a reality, okay. There is important from the ego the all these things are important from the eagle. So when you have a healthy ego you learn how to you know, do things that is good for your physical body. Go to the gym. He healthy, you know, all those things work out, you know, go ahead and on the physical, you know, do what you need to do.

They're in prison to their head and their detached from embodying whatever the hell they thinking or whatever the hell they're saying and these are people that are operating from their false self, you know, and it's a sad reality, you know, you know, you can when you speak to people you can see the Ego versus the true self, you know, you can see the difference. You see what I'm saying? But at the same time when you have unhealthy ego you realize like okay, you know, it's still a part of me. So I'm going to have to utilize this in a proper manner. Where is not consuming me too much where I'm operating from a false self a false identity, you know, you know how many people are operating from a delusional? No mindset, it's a lot and and you know, this is the 3D Matrix, you know, everything that is created here on this physical came from a thought. You see what I'm saying? So everything came out of nothing so all of the stuff that that we give matter to his only important because we created that reality and are self-conscious but there's no importance and the majority of the shit on the 3D Matrix not even your body. It's a reality, okay. There is important from the ego the all these things are important from the eagle. So when you have a healthy ego you learn how to you know, do things that is good for your physical body. Go to the gym.

Now you guys enjoy my podcast for the day have a good one. What's going on told my beautiful listeners on my podcast. I would like to make this episode dedicated to the ego because I just think a lot of people don't understand the eagle and what is all about? Okay, I think some people kind of get it but at the same time You know, I guess because so many people's brain are using the left hemisphere is kind of like it can kind of like fog the broader perspective of of what the ego is all about. Now this three reality this this Matrix, you know right now every what we are experiencing right now. Okay, from what we came out of our mother's womb. Umm to when we leave the physical. This is all ego base. Okay. So this entire room is revolving around ego. All right, we are in the 3D Matrix. We are in the third dimensional density. All right or fear. Okay. We are experiencing this 3D realm in the 3D sphere. All right. so, you know when people in the spiritual Community or real individuals that are doing the spiritual work, you know, they're going to constantly talk about the ego because this is something we really have to become aware of on the 3D Matrix because if we don't become aware of our ego is going to consume us and we're going to start operating from it on a very very very very very extreme rate and that is To call the false self. Okay, so when people operate from their ego on an extreme rate and their detached from who they truly are their authentic being, you know, they're not going to even recognize that they're operating from a false self. And this is why a lot of people have issues with projecting self-reflecting introspecting taking accountability things in that nature because they're operating from their false self and an Same rate. They're very very very very detached from the true self. That is you know, the buried within your being. Okay, the body system is just the mobile. You are not the body you are the soul. The body is just something you're using until you leave when you leave your physical flesh. You're not taking your body with you. Okay, and this is the whole thing where reincarnation if people are not aware of themselves and people are just Doing a lot of toxic shit to each other and and it's sad because there I don't think some people are even capable of acknowledging their own toxic traits because they're operating from the false self. So extremely that they think is normal they think is okay and they just start justifying those things. Like they don't know how to self-reflect. They don't know how to acknowledge like wow. I've been doing this all my life, but I didn't realize how toxic it was to me or others. Some people don't know how to do that and it's a sad reality. But now the twist to this is that people think they know how to take accountability. They think they know who they truly are and they think they know like how to tune in keyword think and that's because many people are trapped in the mind. You know what I'm saying? They they But everything that they are experiencing in the 3D realm there, they're stuck in the mind and they're not really truly embodying the things that they're thinking or saying out of their mouths. You understand what I'm saying? They're not embodying it and this is why so many people don't you know, they don't know how to back up their words what action it's a sad reality. All right, A lot of people are stuck in their head. Ed and detach from the body, you know, they you know, they forgot to to I guess it's not that they've they have blockages from embodying the things that are coming out of their mouth. All right now like I mentioned the Eagles not gonna die if you want to kill the eagle, you have to kill yourself. There's no other way around it. Okay, but when spiritual people say, oh kill the ego they're just talking about become aware of the fucking shit. That's really what they're trying to say. Okay. You know, if you kill the ego your you have to kill yourself because then that means you have to leave your body every matter on this physical is ego-based every materialistic thing. All right, even when we speak every time we express ourselves every time we think okay, all of that is Eagle base. You understand what I'm saying?

Om p r e h-- e NS ible incomprehensible incomprehensible is a very simple adjectives which means impossible to understand. For example, our schools intercom system is so old that this morning's announcements were almost incomprehensible or impossible to understand and synonyms for impossible are the words baffling confusing and bewildering and antonyms for in comprehensible are the words understandable clear plain and intelligible. So that was incomprehensible our first word. How about the second? Manipulate manipulate is spelled maaaaan.

They should be Active and synonyms for manipulate are the words work maneuver exploit and influence. So that was manipulate our second word. Our third word maximum is spelled m ax I am um, and it's a noun that means the greatest possible amount or degree and it can also be used as an adjective which means reaching the greatest possible amount or degree. For example, this postage scale. Can weigh a maximum of only five pounds or we can say to ease the patient suffering the doctor prescribed the maximum dosage of painkillers when synonyms for maximum are the words largest highest or at most and antonyms are the words least lowest minimum or smallest. So that was maximum and how about our fourth and last word for today? Mimic mimic is expelled mi mi see a mimic can be a noun and that means a person who does imitations or it can be a verb and it means to imitate or to make fun of for example, we say the comedy troupe has many talented members, but it's still needs to hire a good mimic a person who does imitations and we can say Troy continually entertains his friends because he can mimic any accent.

    "doc": "You are listening to vocabulary builder from perfect English with Danny learn new words every day. Welcome to a new episode from vocabulary builder. And today we're going to continue our fourth part of week two and four new words are words for today. Are incomprehensible manipulate maximum and mimic. Let's start with the first word incomprehensible. It is a little bit big but we're going to spell It Anyway Inc. Om p r e h-- e NS ible incomprehensible incomprehensible is a very simple adjectives which means impossible to understand. For example, our schools intercom system is so old that this morning's announcements were almost incomprehensible or impossible to understand and synonyms for impossible are the words baffling confusing and bewildering and antonyms for in comprehensible are the words understandable clear plain and intelligible. So that was incomprehensible our first word. How about the second? Manipulate manipulate is spelled maaaaan. I pu late-2008 and it's a verb which means to handle or use skillfully to manage or control for personal gain or Advantage. For example, we say scientists should not manipulate data scientists should not manage or control the data for personal gain or Advantage. They should be Active and synonyms for manipulate are the words work maneuver exploit and influence. So that was manipulate our second word. Our third word maximum is spelled m ax I am um, and it's a noun that means the greatest possible amount or degree and it can also be used as an adjective which means reaching the greatest possible amount or degree. For example, this postage scale. Can weigh a maximum of only five pounds or we can say to ease the patient suffering the doctor prescribed the maximum dosage of painkillers when synonyms for maximum are the words largest highest or at most and antonyms are the words least lowest minimum or smallest. So that was maximum and how about our fourth and last word for today? Mimic mimic is expelled mi mi see a mimic can be a noun and that means a person who does imitations or it can be a verb and it means to imitate or to make fun of for example, we say the comedy troupe has many talented members, but it's still needs to hire a good mimic a person who does imitations and we can say Troy continually entertains his friends because he can mimic any accent.

We are using this valuable space for an ad to advertise anchor which is a free app, which you should go and download to start your own podcast or find and discover more anchor is able to distribute podcast, which is how we get our Podcast on to Spotify and other platforms. So please take a second to go download check it out. See if that making your own podcast. Hey everyone, welcome to not lost just temporarily misplaced. My name is Raymond French and I'm Ross Damon. Today. We're going to be addressing the mountain in the room. What is outdoor education now, I would like to state that these are our opinions and everyone is entitled to their own. All we ask is that you listen with an open mind as this is a big and complex topic that will be reoccurring over the course of our podcast going forward in different episodes and in different ways. Through all the episodes now, we do have a plan to begin. One of our classes has this write a paper on what is our personal philosophy of outdoor education, which is pretty much the who what where when how surrounding the outdoors how do you choose the interact with nature and additionally outdoor education, of course, the beauty of philosophy is that everyone has their own View and opinion of everything especially outdoor education. So let's start with that Raw. Ross what is your personal philosophy of outdoor education? So this is what I stated in my first paragraph of my or my intro paragraph for this final paper that we had to write and I'm going to adjust it a little bit to make it current and make sense. But here we go to me outdoor education is the product of human desire for exploring new ideas wind to find a new way to learn and looking to develop one's understanding of themselves in the world. My Philosophy is based on the idea that outdoor education is a type of experiential education and think of it like a branch of the bare tree outdoor education covers nature and how to create an experience in it. This can be through Tours guided or not skills workshops and recreational activities. The goal of outdoor education is to create a positive worthwhile and educational experience that Fosters a A curiosity for being out in nature. Would you agree right I would to an extent. I think that outdoor education is good to bring people to the Natural aspect of life and to bring apart kind of their own educational values to it and bringing nature involved in education is really important but my philosophy and entered case a little bit more different I considered to be rather simple. Actually, I believe that education is a means to getting people not only outside an environment. That is unique. Different to what they're used to but also for educating them on the importance of preserving and the and knowing if continuing their outdoor experiences, I think it's a fantastic place to build one's self confidence as they Master primitive skills such as Building A Fire or pitching a tent on their own these skills quickly build one self-confidence and Inspire the person to learn more about the Outdoor World around them. The outdoors is also incredibly healthy place for people in a fast traveling world of technology. Now, are you You sure this isn't because you and Technology just don't really agree and probably couldn't use it if your life depended on it. Yeah, I do struggle a lot with technology, but I that's a bit of my own outdoor education side of the Ross clearly has that mastered and Technology better than I do. He's the one obviously publishing this recording and handling all the editing whatnot, which I appreciate him for but I I'm not the most technology person but the constant growth of social media and online distractions can influence and affect someone's someone mentally and physically and I agree with that absolutely which is kind of the rationale and correct me if I'm wrong here behind a lot of therapy trips, which is to remove that element of stress that social media and video games and all that can create in your life or even just email they'll really creates for a lot of People the way I view it is different obviously since you're a therapy person and I'm more of the recreational side get as many people out there enjoying it share it because that'll create kind of a love of it overall. So my view would be along the lines of frontcountry stuff. You should have a shareable memory and a way to share that memory because if you own a guide shopper, A business or something like that that photo or video upload. The social media is essentially advertising at no cost to your business. See I agree with that aspect of the fact that for advertisements and guiding that's great. But why I think about education I think of the growth as the clients not the person providing the adventure experience per se and so when I think of my outdoor experiences removing Technologies important because Just everywhere you go almost everybody has a phone these days least from people that we interact with everyone on the phone. Everyone has a Facebook invite as an email account. And so I think it's important that we step away from that because these devices are addictive to us they suck you in they can control you and so I believe that removing yourself from this technological age can be incredibly healthy because suddenly you're back to your roots. You're going hiking and doesn't have to be like you completely shut out your Phone for a year, it's more like hey for this week long trip. Let's take a disposable camera or a camera that can take pictures and videos but doesn't have a connection to social media and like a GoPro or something small easy to pack that you don't necessarily know and it's going to be kind nice thing to see when you plug it in at the end of your trip, right? It's that that that is what I would recommend. On my end, of course, there's multiple views of this topic, but I think a GoPro type of camera or something that's quick easy doesn't have any connection to the outside world is perfect. And of course, I do take my phone on camping trips, but I take my phone for emergency purposes only the and of course, I'll need Wilderness you very rarely will have actual cell service or technological actions, but I do have it just in case something happens. What are those what I have my and you'll see a lot of other out a lot of other major outdoor people also not having their phones with them because they know it's a distraction from the Beauty in front of them as well as the healthy parts of their own lives. I mean Suddenly by hiking and camping and to use your perspective Ross the sea kayaking and rafting they're suddenly doing these strenuous parts that are getting them on healthier sleeping habits and healthier eating habits by removing them from the technology. They're not awake at night. They're not being kept up late in my by the Phone screen and they're being active which therefore is making you use all that energy that your body is storing up over the course of date of the day eating in and just general healthiness. It's better for you. I always sleep better after doing all these type of activities that I do like I pass out almost immediately if the I would like to add in a recent news article. I did see involving the great state of Vermont which we are right next to currently and New Hampshire, but one of their politicians I'm blanking on who it is at the moment, but they introduced a bill that would ban anyone under the age of 21 from having a phone. So yeah, that's a little bit radical it is and the whole point of this was to create a topic and kind of get it out there that cell phones can have issues and cause problems especially for Younger Generations who are a lot more tech savvy Drew. Yeah. I think we agree at different aspects. We read the same thing at different times we do and that's not a bad thing. Yeah, I think it allows us all to share some opinions and have a nice little conversation. And that's all we're having is a nice conversation, which I think more people should be doing they conversation about",

Yeah, I do struggle a lot with technology, but I that's a bit of my own outdoor education side of the Ross clearly has that mastered and Technology better than I do. He's the one obviously publishing this recording and handling all the editing whatnot, which I appreciate him for but I I'm not the most technology person but the constant growth of social media and online distractions can influence and affect someone's someone mentally and physically and I agree with that absolutely which is kind of the rationale and correct me if I'm wrong here behind a lot of therapy trips, which is to remove that element of stress that social media and video games and all that can create in your life or even just email they'll really creates for a lot of People the way I view it is different obviously since you're a therapy person and I'm more of the recreational side get as many people out there enjoying it share it because that'll create kind of a love of it overall. So my view would be along the lines of frontcountry stuff. You should have a shareable memory and a way to share that memory because if you own a guide shopper, A business or something like that that photo or video upload. The social media is essentially advertising at no cost to your business. See I agree with that aspect of the fact that for advertisements and guiding that's great. But why I think about education I think of the growth as the clients not the person providing the adventure experience per se and so when I think of my outdoor experiences removing Technologies important because Just everywhere you go almost everybody has a phone these days least from people that we interact with everyone on the phone. Everyone has a Facebook invite as an email account. And so I think it's important that we step away from that because these devices are addictive to us they suck you in they can control you and so I believe that removing yourself from this technological age can be incredibly healthy because suddenly you're back to your roots. You're going hiking and doesn't have to be like you completely shut out your Phone for a year, it's more like hey for this week long trip. Let's take a disposable camera or a camera that can take pictures and videos but doesn't have a connection to social media and like a GoPro or something small easy to pack that you don't necessarily know and it's going to be kind nice thing to see when you plug it in at the end of your trip, right? It's that that that is what I would recommend. On my end, of course, there's multiple views of this topic, but I think a GoPro type of camera or something that's quick easy doesn't have any connection to the outside world is perfect. And of course, I do take my phone on camping trips, but I take my phone for emergency purposes only the and of course, I'll need Wilderness you very rarely will have actual cell service or technological actions, but I do have it just in case something happens. What are those what I have my and you'll see a lot of other out a lot of other major outdoor people also not having their phones with them because they know it's a distraction from the Beauty in front of them as well as the healthy parts of their own lives. I mean Suddenly by hiking and camping and to use your perspective Ross the sea kayaking and rafting they're suddenly doing these strenuous parts that are getting them on healthier sleeping habits and healthier eating habits by removing them from the technology. They're not awake at night. They're not being kept up late in my by the Phone screen and they're being active which therefore is making you use all that energy that your body is storing up over the course of date of the day eating in and just general healthiness. It's better for you. I always sleep better after doing all these type of activities that I do like I pass out almost immediately if the I would like to add in a recent news article. I did see involving the great state of Vermont which we are right next to currently and New Hampshire, but one of their politicians I'm blanking on who it is at the moment, but they introduced a bill that would ban anyone under the age of 21 from having a phone. So yeah, that's a little bit radical it is and the whole point of this was to create a topic and kind of get it out there that cell phones can have issues and cause problems especially for Younger Generations who are a lot more tech savvy Drew. Yeah. I think we agree at different aspects. We read the same thing at different times we do and that's not a bad thing. Yeah, I think it allows us all to share some opinions and have a nice little conversation. And that's all we're having is a nice conversation, which I think more people should be doing they conversation about",

Today. We're going to be addressing the mountain in the room. What is outdoor education now, I would like to state that these are our opinions and everyone is entitled to their own. All we ask is that you listen with an open mind as this is a big and complex topic that will be reoccurring over the course of our podcast going forward in different episodes and in different ways. Through all the episodes now, we do have a plan to begin. One of our classes has this write a paper on what is our personal philosophy of outdoor education, which is pretty much the who what where when how surrounding the outdoors how do you choose the interact with nature and additionally outdoor education, of course, the beauty of philosophy is that everyone has their own View and opinion of everything especially outdoor education. So let's start with that Raw. Ross what is your personal philosophy of outdoor education? So this is what I stated in my first paragraph of my or my intro paragraph for this final paper that we had to write and I'm going to adjust it a little bit to make it current and make sense. But here we go to me outdoor education is the product of human desire for exploring new ideas wind to find a new way to learn and looking to develop one's understanding of themselves in the world. My Philosophy is based on the idea that outdoor education is a type of experiential education and think of it like a branch of the bare tree outdoor education covers nature and how to create an experience in it. This can be through Tours guided or not skills workshops and recreational activities. The goal of outdoor education is to create a positive worthwhile and educational experience that Fosters a A curiosity for being out in nature. Would you agree right I would to an extent. I think that outdoor education is good to bring people to the Natural aspect of life and to bring apart kind of their own educational values to it and bringing nature involved in education is really important but my philosophy and entered case a little bit more different I considered to be rather simple. Actually, I believe that education is a means to getting people not only outside an environment. That is unique. Different to what they're used to but also for educating them on the importance of preserving and the and knowing if continuing their outdoor experiences, I think it's a fantastic place to build one's self confidence as they Master primitive skills such as Building A Fire or pitching a tent on their own these skills quickly build one self-confidence and Inspire the person to learn more about the Outdoor World around them.

He's the one obviously publishing this recording and handling all the editing whatnot, which I appreciate him for but I I'm not the most technology person but the constant growth of social media and online distractions can influence and affect someone's someone mentally and physically and I agree with that absolutely which is kind of the rationale and correct me if I'm wrong here behind a lot of therapy trips, which is to remove that element of stress that social media and video games and all that can create in your life or even just email they'll really creates for a lot of People the way I view it is different obviously since you're a therapy person and I'm more of the recreational side get as many people out there enjoying it share it because that'll create kind of a love of it overall. So my view would be along the lines of frontcountry stuff. You should have a shareable memory and a way to share that memory because if you own a guide shopper, A business or something like that that photo or video upload. The social media is essentially advertising at no cost to your business. See I agree with that aspect of the fact that for advertisements and guiding that's great. But why I think about education I think of the growth as the clients not the person providing the adventure experience per se and so when I think of my outdoor experiences removing Technologies important because Just everywhere you go almost everybody has a phone these days least from people that we interact with everyone on the phone. Everyone has a Facebook invite as an email account. And so I think it's important that we step away from that because these devices are addictive to us they suck you in they can control you and so I believe that removing yourself from this technological age can be incredibly healthy because suddenly you're back to your roots. You're going hiking and doesn't have to be like you completely shut out your Phone for a year, it's more like hey for this week long trip. Let's take a disposable camera or a camera that can take pictures and videos but doesn't have a connection to social media and like a GoPro or something small easy to pack that you don't necessarily know and it's going to be kind nice thing to see when you plug it in at the end of your trip, right? It's that that that is what I would recommend. On my end, of course, there's multiple views of this topic, but I think a GoPro type of camera or something that's quick easy doesn't have any connection to the outside world is perfect. And of course, I do take my phone on camping trips, but I take my phone for emergency purposes only the and of course, I'll need Wilderness you very rarely will have actual cell service or technological actions, but I do have it just in case something happens. What are those what I have my and you'll see a lot of other out a lot of other major outdoor people also not having their phones with them because they know it's a distraction from the Beauty in front of them as well as the healthy parts of their own lives. I mean Suddenly by hiking and camping and to use your perspective Ross the sea kayaking and rafting they're suddenly doing these strenuous parts that are getting them on healthier sleeping habits and healthier eating habits by removing them from the technology. They're not awake at night. They're not being kept up late in my by the Phone screen and they're being active which therefore is making you use all that energy that your body is storing up over the course of date of the day eating in and just general healthiness. It's better for you. I always sleep better after doing all these type of activities that I do like I pass out almost immediately if the I would like to add in a recent news article. I did see involving the great state of Vermont which we are right next to currently and New Hampshire, but one of their politicians I'm blanking on who it is at the moment, but they introduced a bill that would ban anyone under the age of 21 from having a phone. So yeah, that's a little bit radical it is and the whole point of this was to create a topic and kind of get it out there that cell phones can have issues and cause problems especially for Younger Generations who are a lot more tech savvy Drew. Yeah. I think we agree at different aspects. We read the same thing at different times we do and that's not a bad thing. Yeah, I think it allows us all to share some opinions and have a nice little conversation. And that's all we're having is a nice conversation, which I think more people should be doing they conversation about",

Today. We're going to be addressing the mountain in the room. What is outdoor education now, I would like to state that these are our opinions and everyone is entitled to their own. All we ask is that you listen with an open mind as this is a big and complex topic that will be reoccurring over the course of our podcast going forward in different episodes and in different ways. Through all the episodes now, we do have a plan to begin. One of our classes has this write a paper on what is our personal philosophy of outdoor education, which is pretty much the who what where when how surrounding the outdoors how do you choose the interact with nature and additionally outdoor education, of course, the beauty of philosophy is that everyone has their own View and opinion of everything especially outdoor education. So let's start with that Raw. Ross what is your personal philosophy of outdoor education? So this is what I stated in my first paragraph of my or my intro paragraph for this final paper that we had to write and I'm going to adjust it a little bit to make it current and make sense. But here we go to me outdoor education is the product of human desire for exploring new ideas wind to find a new way to learn and looking to develop one's understanding of themselves in the world. My Philosophy is based on the idea that outdoor education is a type of experiential education and think of it like a branch of the bare tree outdoor education covers nature and how to create an experience in it. This can be through Tours guided or not skills workshops and recreational activities. The goal of outdoor education is to create a positive worthwhile and educational experience that Fosters a A curiosity for being out in nature. Would you agree right I would to an extent. I think that outdoor education is good to bring people to the Natural aspect of life and to bring apart kind of their own educational values to it and bringing nature involved in education is really important but my philosophy and entered case a little bit more different I considered to be rather simple. Actually, I believe that education is a means to getting people not only outside an environment. That is unique. Different to what they're used to but also for educating them on the importance of preserving and the and knowing if continuing their outdoor experiences, I think it's a fantastic place to build one's self confidence as they Master primitive skills such as Building A Fire or pitching a tent on their own these skills quickly build one self-confidence and Inspire the person to learn more about the Outdoor World around them. The outdoors is also incredibly healthy place for people in a fast traveling world of technology.

He's the one obviously publishing this recording and handling all the editing whatnot, which I appreciate him for but I I'm not the most technology person but the constant growth of social media and online distractions can influence and affect someone's someone mentally and physically and I agree with that absolutely which is kind of the rationale and correct me if I'm wrong here behind a lot of therapy trips, which is to remove that element of stress that social media and video games and all that can create in your life or even just email they'll really creates for a lot of People the way I view it is different obviously since you're a therapy person and I'm more of the recreational side get as many people out there enjoying it share it because that'll create kind of a love of it overall. So my view would be along the lines of frontcountry stuff. You should have a shareable memory and a way to share that memory because if you own a guide shopper, A business or something like that that photo or video upload. The social media is essentially advertising at no cost to your business. See I agree with that aspect of the fact that for advertisements and guiding that's great. But why I think about education I think of the growth as the clients not the person providing the adventure experience per se and so when I think of my outdoor experiences removing Technologies important because Just everywhere you go almost everybody has a phone these days least from people that we interact with everyone on the phone. Everyone has a Facebook invite as an email account. And so I think it's important that we step away from that because these devices are addictive to us they suck you in they can control you and so I believe that removing yourself from this technological age can be incredibly healthy because suddenly you're back to your roots. You're going hiking and doesn't have to be like you completely shut out your Phone for a year, it's more like hey for this week long trip. Let's take a disposable camera or a camera that can take pictures and videos but doesn't have a connection to social media and like a GoPro or something small easy to pack that you don't necessarily know and it's going to be kind nice thing to see when you plug it in at the end of your trip, right? It's that that that is what I would recommend. On my end, of course, there's multiple views of this topic, but I think a GoPro type of camera or something that's quick easy doesn't have any connection to the outside world is perfect. And of course, I do take my phone on camping trips, but I take my phone for emergency purposes only the and of course, I'll need Wilderness you very rarely will have actual cell service or technological actions, but I do have it just in case something happens. What are those what I have my and you'll see a lot of other out a lot of other major outdoor people also not having their phones with them because they know it's a distraction from the Beauty in front of them as well as the healthy parts of their own lives. I mean Suddenly by hiking and camping and to use your perspective Ross the sea kayaking and rafting they're suddenly doing these strenuous parts that are getting them on healthier sleeping habits and healthier eating habits by removing them from the technology. They're not awake at night. They're not being kept up late in my by the Phone screen and they're being active which therefore is making you use all that energy that your body is storing up over the course of date of the day eating in and just general healthiness. It's better for you. I always sleep better after doing all these type of activities that I do like I pass out almost immediately if the I would like to add in a recent news article. I did see involving the great state of Vermont which we are right next to currently and New Hampshire, but one of their politicians I'm blanking on who it is at the moment, but they introduced a bill that would ban anyone under the age of 21 from having a phone. So yeah, that's a little bit radical it is and the whole point of this was to create a topic and kind of get it out there that cell phones can have issues and cause problems especially for Younger Generations who are a lot more tech savvy Drew. Yeah. I think we agree at different aspects. We read the same thing at different times we do and that's not a bad thing. Yeah, I think it allows us all to share some opinions and have a nice little conversation. And that's all we're having is a nice conversation, which I think more people should be doing they conversation about",

This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York. Is this kind of flying trash that gets in our way. That is not how we always thought about pigeons and Fact for most of human history, we love them. They were domesticated that we think as long as 5,000 years ago the first bird to be domesticated one of the first five animals to be domesticated and so they were bred as a food source also, of course because they can find their way home from somewhere. They've never been up to a thousand miles away. So they were the first Messengers before, you know, telegraph's what have you so that's what brought them everywhere pigeons delivered the news of the first Olympic Games, you know, the original ones like yeah in ancient Greece. Is Con use them to send messages throughout his Empire since the time of the Pharaohs pigeons had played a role in sending messages, especially when there was a war they were the internet the telegram the telephone of their day. In fact, we know that if we don't tell you the story of one very famous wartime pigeon. We are going to get letters right Cher Ami Cher Ami was a pigeon enlisted in the Army in World War 1. This is like the Rambo of pigeons a lot of people credit this bird with being a hundred ninety four American lives after a unit was separated from its division Behind Enemy Lines Cher Ami brought a message and while I was doing so it was actually shot in the chest when it arrived back at it scoop its leg was dangling off its body and I think this demonstrates the degree to which pigeons were exalted Legend has it that Jeremy's handlers made him a little Peg Leg to replace the leg that was shot off and he was awarded the Croix De Guerre by the French for his service. You can actually see Jeremy's little taxidermied body in the Smithsonian and it wasn't just that one pigeon or that we thought of pigeons as useful. We thought they were beautiful in the late 19th century pigeon fancying breeding and admiring the birds like we do today with the Westminster dog show it became this fashionable upper-class hobby Rich dignified ladies from the Upper East Side would go to the park with their Maids lugging bags of seeds for them just to feed the pigeons and bankers on Wall Street would go out on their lunch break. Brakes and buy seed from vendors just to feed the pigeons and we ate them a lot. They were like chicken is today people in cities kept coops full of pigeons on their roofs. They were small. So if you had to feed a whole family, maybe you'd go up and grab three or four to cook dinner pigeons were so useful. There are some versatile. They were like the Swiss Army knives of birds from Linea humans really loved pigeons Millennia and seriously Adam were a",

This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them.

This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York.

This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York. Is this kind of flying trash that gets in our way. That is not how we always thought about pigeons and Fact for most of human history, we love them. They were domesticated that we think as long as 5,000 years ago the first bird to be domesticated one of the first five animals to be domesticated and so they were bred as a food source also, of course because they can find their way home from somewhere.

This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York. Is this kind of flying trash that gets in our way. That is not how we always thought about pigeons and Fact for most of human history, we love them. They were domesticated that we think as long as 5,000 years ago the first bird to be domesticated one of the first five animals to be domesticated and so they were bred as a food source also, of course because they can find their way home from somewhere.

This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York. Is this kind of flying trash that gets in our way. That is not how we always thought about pigeons and Fact for most of human history, we love them. They were domesticated that we think as long as 5,000 years ago the first bird to be domesticated one of the first five animals to be domesticated and so they were bred as a food source also, of course because they can find their way home from somewhere. They've never been up to a thousand miles away.

This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York. Is this kind of flying trash that gets in our way. That is not how we always thought about pigeons and Fact for most of human history, we love them. They were domesticated that we think as long as 5,000 years ago the first bird to be domesticated one of the first five animals to be domesticated and so they were bred as a food source also, of course because they can find their way home from somewhere.

    "doc": "Is a little bloody. Bloody I did not expect to feel the least bit squeamish Readiness and like if I'm being honest, I'm a little grossed out right now. There's often reasons why we don't eat certain foods anymore. You know, it's a small bird without a lot of meat in a very very distinct taste and texture that's not going to appeal to everybody that small bird. the pigeon from gimlet media. This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York. Is this kind of flying trash that gets in our way. That is not how we always thought about pigeons and Fact for most of human history, we love them. They were domesticated that we think as long as 5,000 years ago the first bird to be domesticated one of the first five animals to be domesticated and so they were bred as a food source also, of course because they can find their way home from somewhere. They've never been up to a thousand miles away. So they were the first Messengers before, you know, telegraph's what have you so that's what brought them everywhere pigeons delivered the news of the first Olympic Games, you know, the original ones like yeah in ancient Greece. Is Con use them to send messages throughout his Empire since the time of the Pharaohs pigeons had played a role in sending messages, especially when there was a war they were the internet the telegram the telephone of their day.

    "doc": "Hello, everyone. It is Bryson and a fell here Return of the champ. Shut the fuck up. Oh my God, he's just really pretty. We'ii. Just were we everyone everyone else gave up everyone else gave up. I kept it. He gave up Alonzo. I always kept it open for him. Everyone gave up this, you know even be I was like, you know, Josh board is probably not going to be on the team not putting any faith in Josh board and then all of a sudden we were like, nope screw this we're ready to get our hearts broken Joshua's going to eat that snack every night every night Josh Gordon tweets. I've been tweeting about Josh Gordon been thinking about him. I was just came home. I'm literally on the road home from Tennessee Titans Patriots joint practices. I've been thinking about Josh Gordon and how long would use just throw into gonna cross you see whatever his name is and that guy. Okay, no fuck contrl. Oh, no. No, he has a family he has a family. He's a nice guy no gutters and nice guy gun was a nice guy. He's like my tweets God. I love gone here. I love Gunner practice squad, Josh Gordon. No, yeah. Okay. Yep. Josh Gordon is back. Josh. Gordon is back and we're going to we're going to record a little you know, recap with a Patriots Titans practices along with week. One preseason along with the week two preseason prove you after this, but right now it is free Josh Gordon Tom. He is free what? Okay Lawns it how many yards is going to have he's gonna play 19 games right? Like he's gonna have at least twenty three hundred yards in the 1923. Here, it's okay. He's gonna play he's I agree. He's gonna happen that he might be MVP. I've actually I'm looking at I'm looking at the odds right now and it doesn't seem that crazy to me 1001, but whatever I'm going with it. I I'm hey, I'm mulling I'm all-in I am all in here's the thing with Josh Gordon. Okay, if you're amazing and beautiful, okay? Yes. Yes, but if you're half in on Josh Gordon then get out get out go. Fuck you go. Fuck. Yo. Fuck you. I don't go just just go. Okay. The full experience which is the week one key plays well called 45 plays. He still using himself into shape. You know, I'll fill Dorset places many snaps. You got some Targets on third down Brady maybe throws a job. No, stop talking about filbert said fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. He's getting cut but but let's but here is okay. Okay here is my point is like the first couple weeks. It may be they use them in you'll be able a full-time Starter by like week three weeks for and if you're just not all in then you're missing out you're missing it out. I mean if he if he gets ripped away once again, if he gets ripped away from Alonzo and you and you were prepared for that you did not live because for the weeks he is in he is special special special player special. Okay, Alonzo. I just want to say that josh board. He already knows our Playbook. He's ready. He's probably in shape like why would he not play all the snaps week one? What do you what do you mean? Yeah, I'm leaving you come in. He's come you miss all of training camp alongside. Okay. Wait, no stop just stop right there. Stop. He has at least the preseason has a couple weeks and most important weeks of the preseason Hobie there that like you just said the media won't be there. He's going to be amazing. You don't have to rely on NICU Harry to be amazing anymore. You don't have to do that. You don't have to start Jacoby Myers. You don't have to worry about that. Now you have Edelman you have Edelman Josh Warden back and the third receiver is going to be in his role. It's fine. That's the band the third receiver exact. Yep. Whoever did this makes it perfect because Josh Gordon is one of the best is one of the best receivers in the entire NFL outside receive a pass when he's healthy and he's going to be he's going to be doing that kind of stuff and he is going to be amazing and adleman candida to and playing the slot and that's what I really like about this. This is going to be the underrated part. We've talked about it Edelman making his transition to the stop playing outside as much roll and I I don't totally agree. Yes, because you have you had a few Harry keep Josh they wanted to keep him outside. Okay, but now you have but now you have nikhil Harry and Josh Gordon who can play outside and do animals Unstoppable inside. Why would you not just put them inside the Forum or not Sam? Okay. This is what I'm saying before Joy not onl Min is a 48% inside guy for his career. Now, let's make them a 65% inside guy not. Quite Welker yet. But let's let's put them in there have Josh Gordon NICU Harry the rest of those guys man the outside and let joy in ottoman just go to work and his later portion of his career. Yeah, I the Patriots wanted to do the opposite with Edelman this off. I don't like that. They try I mean they tried signing home fries. They tried signing Beasley. They wanted to move them. They want to keep them outside. They want to guys kind of play that and it beats me man. He why maybe because it doesn't that make more sense to just put them in the takes a beating in the slot more than he does outside. That's just a fact. I don't know. I mean take more hits over the middle and do playing outside. It doesn't really matter. The point is however you put Edelman. Gordon is 1/2. And I actually would tend to the film Cattlemen's more the one than War. Yes, Gordon might be more traditional weird might be more of a traditional like X receiver. Number one type guy but Edelman is really the fulcrum of the offense is still the most important player on the offense outside of Brady. I think that almonds you're like nominal number one receiver in any case Edelman one Gordon to Borden one atom into those guys were perfect in their roles Gordon. Is it top to type caliber receive? Edelman is a top two caliber receiver on a good offense. I don't I don't think Jacoby Myers. Is that right? I filled her said it's certainly not that and they kill Harry hopefully becomes that eventually maybe he develops into it by the end of the year. But as of now, he wasn't even running with the starters and training camp. So now you just you have certainty for however long Gordon lasts and hopefully again, it's most of the Season you have certainty in terms of your tattoo guys at receiver and then all the guys think just thrown against the wall. See what sticks right your your Myers your hairy your Dorset. Your Maurice Harris was going to be out for a while. He has like a calf injury. I think you're bad scenarios your Gunners. You're done trolling means all those players. They're not now competing for like they are shaking their Rita 5. They're shaking in their shoes. You're all shaking in your shoes. The NFL Braxton various. We're gonna race Harris girl shaking legs are shaking. They're competing to be We are competing to be numbers 3 4 and 5 on the depth chart and the be situational players in this offense. But now it's perfect. It's perfect you have at home and you have Gordon and in certain situations you put Myers in there you put Dorset in there you put Harry in there. You don't have to rush Harry in and overwhelm him after he was limited for most to Camp. It's perfect. He's here and he's perfect and he's Josh Gordon and I He's gonna be walking out on the field with his with the cut-offs. He's gonna have a cut off of inside steps are going to be freaking huge. He's going to be very handsome. He's yeah, it's the NFL should be very afraid. Tom Brady would Josh Gordon for 16 games. And by the way, it's already looked amazing. Tom Brady looked amazing this week by the way. Like I'm just imagining imagining Tom Brady into those joint practices with a really good team. But with Josh Gordon said instead of gunnard, you could be Myers, but it's",

He's a nice guy no gutters and nice guy gun was a nice guy. He's like my tweets God. I love gone here. I love Gunner practice squad, Josh Gordon. No, yeah. Okay. Yep. Josh Gordon is back. Josh. Gordon is back and we're going to we're going to record a little you know, recap with a Patriots Titans practices along with week. One preseason along with the week two preseason prove you after this, but right now it is free Josh Gordon Tom. He is free what? Okay Lawns it how many yards is going to have he's gonna play 19 games right? Like he's gonna have at least twenty three hundred yards in the 1923. Here, it's okay. He's gonna play he's I agree. He's gonna happen that he might be MVP. I've actually I'm looking at I'm looking at the odds right now and it doesn't seem that crazy to me 1001, but whatever I'm going with it. I I'm hey, I'm mulling I'm all-in I am all in here's the thing with Josh Gordon. Okay, if you're amazing and beautiful, okay? Yes. Yes, but if you're half in on Josh Gordon then get out get out go. Fuck you go. Fuck. Yo. Fuck you. I don't go just just go. Okay. The full experience which is the week one key plays well called 45 plays. He still using himself into shape. You know, I'll fill Dorset places many snaps. You got some Targets on third down Brady maybe throws a job. No, stop talking about filbert said fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. He's getting cut but but let's but here is okay. Okay here is my point is like the first couple weeks. It may be they use them in you'll be able a full-time Starter by like week three weeks for and if you're just not all in then you're missing out you're missing it out. I mean if he if he gets ripped away once again, if he gets ripped away from Alonzo and you and you were prepared for that you did not live because for the weeks he is in he is special special special player special. Okay, Alonzo. I just want to say that josh board. He already knows our Playbook. He's ready. He's probably in shape like why would he not play all the snaps week one? What do you what do you mean? Yeah, I'm leaving you come in. He's come you miss all of training camp alongside. Okay. Wait, no stop just stop right there. Stop. He has at least the preseason has a couple weeks and most important weeks of the preseason Hobie there that like you just said the media won't be there. He's going to be amazing. You don't have to rely on NICU Harry to be amazing anymore. You don't have to do that. You don't have to start Jacoby Myers. You don't have to worry about that. Now you have Edelman you have Edelman Josh Warden back and the third receiver is going to be in his role. It's fine. That's the band the third receiver exact. Yep. Whoever did this makes it perfect because Josh Gordon is one of the best is one of the best receivers in the entire NFL outside receive a pass when he's healthy and he's going to be he's going to be doing that kind of stuff and he is going to be amazing and adleman candida to and playing the slot and that's what I really like about this. This is going to be the underrated part. We've talked about it Edelman making his transition to the stop playing outside as much roll and I I don't totally agree. Yes, because you have you had a few Harry keep Josh they wanted to keep him outside. Okay, but now you have but now you have nikhil Harry and Josh Gordon who can play outside and do animals Unstoppable inside. Why would you not just put them inside the Forum or not Sam? Okay. This is what I'm saying before Joy not onl Min is a 48% inside guy for his career. Now, let's make them a 65% inside guy not. Quite Welker yet. But let's let's put them in there have Josh Gordon NICU Harry the rest of those guys man the outside and let joy in ottoman just go to work and his later portion of his career. Yeah, I the Patriots wanted to do the opposite with Edelman this off. I don't like that. They try I mean they tried signing home fries. They tried signing Beasley. They wanted to move them. They want to keep them outside. They want to guys kind of play that and it beats me man. He why maybe because it doesn't that make more sense to just put them in the takes a beating in the slot more than he does outside. That's just a fact. I don't know. I mean take more hits over the middle and do playing outside. It doesn't really matter. The point is however you put Edelman. Gordon is 1/2. And I actually would tend to the film Cattlemen's more the one than War. Yes, Gordon might be more traditional weird might be more of a traditional like X receiver. Number one type guy but Edelman is really the fulcrum of the offense is still the most important player on the offense outside of Brady. I think that almonds you're like nominal number one receiver in any case Edelman one Gordon to Borden one atom into those guys were perfect in their roles Gordon. Is it top to type caliber receive? Edelman is a top two caliber receiver on a good offense. I don't I don't think Jacoby Myers. Is that right? I filled her said it's certainly not that and they kill Harry hopefully becomes that eventually maybe he develops into it by the end of the year. But as of now, he wasn't even running with the starters and training camp. So now you just you have certainty for however long Gordon lasts and hopefully again, it's most of the Season you have certainty in terms of your tattoo guys at receiver and then all the guys think just thrown against the wall. See what sticks right your your Myers your hairy your Dorset. Your Maurice Harris was going to be out for a while. He has like a calf injury. I think you're bad scenarios your Gunners. You're done trolling means all those players. They're not now competing for like they are shaking their Rita 5. They're shaking in their shoes. You're all shaking in your shoes. The NFL Braxton various. We're gonna race Harris girl shaking legs are shaking. They're competing to be We are competing to be numbers 3 4 and 5 on the depth chart and the be situational players in this offense. But now it's perfect. It's perfect you have at home and you have Gordon and in certain situations you put Myers in there you put Dorset in there you put Harry in there. You don't have to rush Harry in and overwhelm him after he was limited for most to Camp. It's perfect. He's here and he's perfect and he's Josh Gordon and I He's gonna be walking out on the field with his with the cut-offs. He's gonna have a cut off of inside steps are going to be freaking huge. He's going to be very handsome. He's yeah, it's the NFL should be very afraid. Tom Brady would Josh Gordon for 16 games. And by the way, it's already looked amazing. Tom Brady looked amazing this week by the way. Like I'm just imagining imagining Tom Brady into those joint practices with a really good team.

You know, I'll fill Dorset places many snaps. You got some Targets on third down Brady maybe throws a job. No, stop talking about filbert said fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. He's getting cut but but let's but here is okay. Okay here is my point is like the first couple weeks. It may be they use them in you'll be able a full-time Starter by like week three weeks for and if you're just not all in then you're missing out you're missing it out. I mean if he if he gets ripped away once again, if he gets ripped away from Alonzo and you and you were prepared for that you did not live because for the weeks he is in he is special special special player special. Okay, Alonzo. I just want to say that josh board. He already knows our Playbook. He's ready. He's probably in shape like why would he not play all the snaps week one? What do you what do you mean? Yeah, I'm leaving you come in. He's come you miss all of training camp alongside. Okay. Wait, no stop just stop right there. Stop. He has at least the preseason has a couple weeks and most important weeks of the preseason Hobie there that like you just said the media won't be there. He's going to be amazing. You don't have to rely on NICU Harry to be amazing anymore. You don't have to do that. You don't have to start Jacoby Myers. You don't have to worry about that. Now you have Edelman you have Edelman Josh Warden back and the third receiver is going to be in his role. It's fine. That's the band the third receiver exact. Yep. Whoever did this makes it perfect because Josh Gordon is one of the best is one of the best receivers in the entire NFL outside receive a pass when he's healthy and he's going to be he's going to be doing that kind of stuff and he is going to be amazing and adleman candida to and playing the slot and that's what I really like about this. This is going to be the underrated part. We've talked about it Edelman making his transition to the stop playing outside as much roll and I I don't totally agree. Yes, because you have you had a few Harry keep Josh they wanted to keep him outside. Okay, but now you have but now you have nikhil Harry and Josh Gordon who can play outside and do animals Unstoppable inside. Why would you not just put them inside the Forum or not Sam? Okay. This is what I'm saying before Joy not onl Min is a 48% inside guy for his career. Now, let's make them a 65% inside guy not. Quite Welker yet. But let's let's put them in there have Josh Gordon NICU Harry the rest of those guys man the outside and let joy in ottoman just go to work and his later portion of his career. Yeah, I the Patriots wanted to do the opposite with Edelman this off. I don't like that. They try I mean they tried signing home fries. They tried signing Beasley. They wanted to move them. They want to keep them outside. They want to guys kind of play that and it beats me man. He why maybe because it doesn't that make more sense to just put them in the takes a beating in the slot more than he does outside. That's just a fact. I don't know. I mean take more hits over the middle and do playing outside. It doesn't really matter. The point is however you put Edelman. Gordon is 1/2. And I actually would tend to the film Cattlemen's more the one than War. Yes, Gordon might be more traditional weird might be more of a traditional like X receiver. Number one type guy but Edelman is really the fulcrum of the offense is still the most important player on the offense outside of Brady. I think that almonds you're like nominal number one receiver in any case Edelman one Gordon to Borden one atom into those guys were perfect in their roles Gordon. Is it top to type caliber receive? Edelman is a top two caliber receiver on a good offense. I don't I don't think Jacoby Myers. Is that right? I filled her said it's certainly not that and they kill Harry hopefully becomes that eventually maybe he develops into it by the end of the year. But as of now, he wasn't even running with the starters and training camp. So now you just you have certainty for however long Gordon lasts and hopefully again, it's most of the Season you have certainty in terms of your tattoo guys at receiver and then all the guys think just thrown against the wall. See what sticks right your your Myers your hairy your Dorset. Your Maurice Harris was going to be out for a while. He has like a calf injury. I think you're bad scenarios your Gunners.

Gordon is back and we're going to we're going to record a little you know, recap with a Patriots Titans practices along with week. One preseason along with the week two preseason prove you after this, but right now it is free Josh Gordon Tom. He is free what? Okay Lawns it how many yards is going to have he's gonna play 19 games right? Like he's gonna have at least twenty three hundred yards in the 1923. Here, it's okay. He's gonna play he's I agree. He's gonna happen that he might be MVP. I've actually I'm looking at I'm looking at the odds right now and it doesn't seem that crazy to me 1001, but whatever I'm going with it. I I'm hey, I'm mulling I'm all-in I am all in here's the thing with Josh Gordon. Okay, if you're amazing and beautiful, okay? Yes. Yes, but if you're half in on Josh Gordon then get out get out go. Fuck you go. Fuck. Yo. Fuck you. I don't go just just go. Okay. The full experience which is the week one key plays well called 45 plays. He still using himself into shape. You know, I'll fill Dorset places many snaps. You got some Targets on third down Brady maybe throws a job. No, stop talking about filbert said fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. He's getting cut but but let's but here is okay. Okay here is my point is like the first couple weeks. It may be they use them in you'll be able a full-time Starter by like week three weeks for and if you're just not all in then you're missing out you're missing it out. I mean if he if he gets ripped away once again, if he gets ripped away from Alonzo and you and you were prepared for that you did not live because for the weeks he is in he is special special special player special. Okay, Alonzo. I just want to say that josh board. He already knows our Playbook. He's ready. He's probably in shape like why would he not play all the snaps week one? What do you what do you mean? Yeah, I'm leaving you come in. He's come you miss all of training camp alongside. Okay. Wait, no stop just stop right there. Stop. He has at least the preseason has a couple weeks and most important weeks of the preseason Hobie there that like you just said the media won't be there. He's going to be amazing. You don't have to rely on NICU Harry to be amazing anymore. You don't have to do that. You don't have to start Jacoby Myers. You don't have to worry about that. Now you have Edelman you have Edelman Josh Warden back and the third receiver is going to be in his role. It's fine. That's the band the third receiver exact. Yep. Whoever did this makes it perfect because Josh Gordon is one of the best is one of the best receivers in the entire NFL outside receive a pass when he's healthy and he's going to be he's going to be doing that kind of stuff and he is going to be amazing and adleman candida to and playing the slot and that's what I really like about this.

Yes, because you have you had a few Harry keep Josh they wanted to keep him outside. Okay, but now you have but now you have nikhil Harry and Josh Gordon who can play outside and do animals Unstoppable inside. Why would you not just put them inside the Forum or not Sam? Okay. This is what I'm saying before Joy not onl Min is a 48% inside guy for his career. Now, let's make them a 65% inside guy not. Quite Welker yet.

They want to keep them outside. They want to guys kind of play that and it beats me man. He why maybe because it doesn't that make more sense to just put them in the takes a beating in the slot more than he does outside. That's just a fact. I don't know. I mean take more hits over the middle and do playing outside. It doesn't really matter. The point is however you put Edelman. Gordon is 1/2. And I actually would tend to the film Cattlemen's more the one than War. Yes, Gordon might be more traditional weird might be more of a traditional like X receiver. Number one type guy but Edelman is really the fulcrum of the offense is still the most important player on the offense outside of Brady. I think that almonds you're like nominal number one receiver in any case Edelman one Gordon to Borden one atom into those guys were perfect in their roles Gordon. Is it top to type caliber receive? Edelman is a top two caliber receiver on a good offense. I don't I don't think Jacoby Myers. Is that right? I filled her said it's certainly not that and they kill Harry hopefully becomes that eventually maybe he develops into it by the end of the year. But as of now, he wasn't even running with the starters and training camp. So now you just you have certainty for however long Gordon lasts and hopefully again, it's most of the Season you have certainty in terms of your tattoo guys at receiver and then all the guys think just thrown against the wall. See what sticks right your your Myers your hairy your Dorset. Your Maurice Harris was going to be out for a while. He has like a calf injury. I think you're bad scenarios your Gunners.

It's perfect you have at home and you have Gordon and in certain situations you put Myers in there you put Dorset in there you put Harry in there. You don't have to rush Harry in and overwhelm him after he was limited for most to Camp. It's perfect. He's here and he's perfect and he's Josh Gordon and I He's gonna be walking out on the field with his with the cut-offs. He's gonna have a cut off of inside steps are going to be freaking huge.

Gordon is back and we're going to we're going to record a little you know, recap with a Patriots Titans practices along with week. One preseason along with the week two preseason prove you after this, but right now it is free Josh Gordon Tom. He is free what? Okay Lawns it how many yards is going to have he's gonna play 19 games right? Like he's gonna have at least twenty three hundred yards in the 1923. Here, it's okay. He's gonna play he's I agree. He's gonna happen that he might be MVP. I've actually I'm looking at I'm looking at the odds right now and it doesn't seem that crazy to me 1001, but whatever I'm going with it. I I'm hey, I'm mulling I'm all-in I am all in here's the thing with Josh Gordon. Okay, if you're amazing and beautiful, okay? Yes. Yes, but if you're half in on Josh Gordon then get out get out go. Fuck you go. Fuck. Yo. Fuck you. I don't go just just go. Okay. The full experience which is the week one key plays well called 45 plays. He still using himself into shape. You know, I'll fill Dorset places many snaps. You got some Targets on third down Brady maybe throws a job. No, stop talking about filbert said fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. He's getting cut but but let's but here is okay. Okay here is my point is like the first couple weeks. It may be they use them in you'll be able a full-time Starter by like week three weeks for and if you're just not all in then you're missing out you're missing it out. I mean if he if he gets ripped away once again, if he gets ripped away from Alonzo and you and you were prepared for that you did not live because for the weeks he is in he is special special special player special. Okay, Alonzo. I just want to say that josh board. He already knows our Playbook. He's ready. He's probably in shape like why would he not play all the snaps week one? What do you what do you mean? Yeah, I'm leaving you come in. He's come you miss all of training camp alongside. Okay. Wait, no stop just stop right there. Stop. He has at least the preseason has a couple weeks and most important weeks of the preseason Hobie there that like you just said the media won't be there. He's going to be amazing. You don't have to rely on NICU Harry to be amazing anymore. You don't have to do that. You don't have to start Jacoby Myers. You don't have to worry about that. Now you have Edelman you have Edelman Josh Warden back and the third receiver is going to be in his role. It's fine. That's the band the third receiver exact. Yep. Whoever did this makes it perfect because Josh Gordon is one of the best is one of the best receivers in the entire NFL outside receive a pass when he's healthy and he's going to be he's going to be doing that kind of stuff and he is going to be amazing and adleman candida to and playing the slot and that's what I really like about this. This is going to be the underrated part. We've talked about it Edelman making his transition to the stop playing outside as much roll and I I don't totally agree. Yes, because you have you had a few Harry keep Josh they wanted to keep him outside. Okay, but now you have but now you have nikhil Harry and Josh Gordon who can play outside and do animals Unstoppable inside. Why would you not just put them inside the Forum or not Sam? Okay. This is what I'm saying before Joy not onl Min is a 48% inside guy for his career. Now, let's make them a 65% inside guy not. Quite Welker yet. But let's let's put them in there have Josh Gordon NICU Harry the rest of those guys man the outside and let joy in ottoman just go to work and his later portion of his career. Yeah, I the Patriots wanted to do the opposite with Edelman this off. I don't like that. They try I mean they tried signing home fries. They tried signing Beasley. They wanted to move them. They want to keep them outside. They want to guys kind of play that and it beats me man. He why maybe because it doesn't that make more sense to just put them in the takes a beating in the slot more than he does outside. That's just a fact. I don't know. I mean take more hits over the middle and do playing outside. It doesn't really matter. The point is however you put Edelman. Gordon is 1/2. And I actually would tend to the film Cattlemen's more the one than War. Yes, Gordon might be more traditional weird might be more of a traditional like X receiver. Number one type guy but Edelman is really the fulcrum of the offense is still the most important player on the offense outside of Brady. I think that almonds you're like nominal number one receiver in any case Edelman one Gordon to Borden one atom into those guys were perfect in their roles Gordon. Is it top to type caliber receive? Edelman is a top two caliber receiver on a good offense. I don't I don't think Jacoby Myers. Is that right? I filled her said it's certainly not that and they kill Harry hopefully becomes that eventually maybe he develops into it by the end of the year. But as of now, he wasn't even running with the starters and training camp. So now you just you have certainty for however long Gordon lasts and hopefully again, it's most of the Season you have certainty in terms of your tattoo guys at receiver and then all the guys think just thrown against the wall. See what sticks right your your Myers your hairy your Dorset. Your Maurice Harris was going to be out for a while. He has like a calf injury. I think you're bad scenarios your Gunners. You're done trolling means all those players. They're not now competing for like they are shaking their Rita 5. They're shaking in their shoes. You're all shaking in your shoes. The NFL Braxton various. We're gonna race Harris girl shaking legs are shaking. They're competing to be We are competing to be numbers 3 4 and 5 on the depth chart and the be situational players in this offense. But now it's perfect. It's perfect you have at home and you have Gordon and in certain situations you put Myers in there you put Dorset in there you put Harry in there. You don't have to rush Harry in and overwhelm him after he was limited for most to Camp. It's perfect. He's here and he's perfect and he's Josh Gordon and I He's gonna be walking out on the field with his with the cut-offs. He's gonna have a cut off of inside steps are going to be freaking huge. He's going to be very handsome. He's yeah, it's the NFL should be very afraid. Tom Brady would Josh Gordon for 16 games. And by the way, it's already looked amazing. Tom Brady looked amazing this week by the way. Like I'm just imagining imagining Tom Brady into those joint practices with a really good team.

He's a nice guy no gutters and nice guy gun was a nice guy. He's like my tweets God. I love gone here. I love Gunner practice squad, Josh Gordon. No, yeah. Okay. Yep. Josh Gordon is back. Josh. Gordon is back and we're going to we're going to record a little you know, recap with a Patriots Titans practices along with week. One preseason along with the week two preseason prove you after this, but right now it is free Josh Gordon Tom. He is free what? Okay Lawns it how many yards is going to have he's gonna play 19 games right? Like he's gonna have at least twenty three hundred yards in the 1923. Here, it's okay. He's gonna play he's I agree. He's gonna happen that he might be MVP. I've actually I'm looking at I'm looking at the odds right now and it doesn't seem that crazy to me 1001, but whatever I'm going with it. I I'm hey, I'm mulling I'm all-in I am all in here's the thing with Josh Gordon. Okay, if you're amazing and beautiful, okay? Yes. Yes, but if you're half in on Josh Gordon then get out get out go. Fuck you go. Fuck. Yo. Fuck you. I don't go just just go. Okay. The full experience which is the week one key plays well called 45 plays. He still using himself into shape. You know, I'll fill Dorset places many snaps. You got some Targets on third down Brady maybe throws a job. No, stop talking about filbert said fuck that guy. Fuck that guy. He's getting cut but but let's but here is okay. Okay here is my point is like the first couple weeks. It may be they use them in you'll be able a full-time Starter by like week three weeks for and if you're just not all in then you're missing out you're missing it out. I mean if he if he gets ripped away once again, if he gets ripped away from Alonzo and you and you were prepared for that you did not live because for the weeks he is in he is special special special player special. Okay, Alonzo. I just want to say that josh board. He already knows our Playbook. He's ready. He's probably in shape like why would he not play all the snaps week one? What do you what do you mean? Yeah, I'm leaving you come in. He's come you miss all of training camp alongside. Okay. Wait, no stop just stop right there. Stop. He has at least the preseason has a couple weeks and most important weeks of the preseason Hobie there that like you just said the media won't be there. He's going to be amazing. You don't have to rely on NICU Harry to be amazing anymore. You don't have to do that. You don't have to start Jacoby Myers. You don't have to worry about that.

Yes, because you have you had a few Harry keep Josh they wanted to keep him outside. Okay, but now you have but now you have nikhil Harry and Josh Gordon who can play outside and do animals Unstoppable inside. Why would you not just put them inside the Forum or not Sam? Okay. This is what I'm saying before Joy not onl Min is a 48% inside guy for his career. Now, let's make them a 65% inside guy not. Quite Welker yet.

He why maybe because it doesn't that make more sense to just put them in the takes a beating in the slot more than he does outside. That's just a fact. I don't know. I mean take more hits over the middle and do playing outside. It doesn't really matter. The point is however you put Edelman. Gordon is 1/2. And I actually would tend to the film Cattlemen's more the one than War. Yes, Gordon might be more traditional weird might be more of a traditional like X receiver. Number one type guy but Edelman is really the fulcrum of the offense is still the most important player on the offense outside of Brady. I think that almonds you're like nominal number one receiver in any case Edelman one Gordon to Borden one atom into those guys were perfect in their roles Gordon. Is it top to type caliber receive?

I filled her said it's certainly not that and they kill Harry hopefully becomes that eventually maybe he develops into it by the end of the year.

This is what I'm saying before Joy not onl Min is a 48% inside guy for his career. Now, let's make them a 65% inside guy not. Quite Welker yet. But let's let's put them in there have Josh Gordon NICU Harry the rest of those guys man the outside and let joy in ottoman just go to work and his later portion of his career. Yeah, I the Patriots wanted to do the opposite with Edelman this off. I don't like that. They try I mean they tried signing home fries. They tried signing Beasley. They wanted to move them. They want to keep them outside. They want to guys kind of play that and it beats me man. He why maybe because it doesn't that make more sense to just put them in the takes a beating in the slot more than he does outside. That's just a fact. I don't know. I mean take more hits over the middle and do playing outside. It doesn't really matter. The point is however you put Edelman. Gordon is 1/2. And I actually would tend to the film Cattlemen's more the one than War. Yes, Gordon might be more traditional weird might be more of a traditional like X receiver. Number one type guy but Edelman is really the fulcrum of the offense is still the most important player on the offense outside of Brady. I think that almonds you're like nominal number one receiver in any case Edelman one Gordon to Borden one atom into those guys were perfect in their roles Gordon. Is it top to type caliber receive? Edelman is a top two caliber receiver on a good offense. I don't I don't think Jacoby Myers. Is that right? I filled her said it's certainly not that and they kill Harry hopefully becomes that eventually maybe he develops into it by the end of the year. But as of now, he wasn't even running with the starters and training camp. So now you just you have certainty for however long Gordon lasts and hopefully again, it's most of the Season you have certainty in terms of your tattoo guys at receiver and then all the guys think just thrown against the wall. See what sticks right your your Myers your hairy your Dorset. Your Maurice Harris was going to be out for a while. He has like a calf injury. I think you're bad scenarios your Gunners. You're done trolling means all those players. They're not now competing for like they are shaking their Rita 5. They're shaking in their shoes. You're all shaking in your shoes. The NFL Braxton various. We're gonna race Harris girl shaking legs are shaking. They're competing to be We are competing to be numbers 3 4 and 5 on the depth chart and the be situational players in this offense. But now it's perfect. It's perfect you have at home and you have Gordon and in certain situations you put Myers in there you put Dorset in there you put Harry in there. You don't have to rush Harry in and overwhelm him after he was limited for most to Camp. It's perfect. He's here and he's perfect and he's Josh Gordon and I He's gonna be walking out on the field with his with the cut-offs. He's gonna have a cut off of inside steps are going to be freaking huge. He's going to be very handsome. He's yeah, it's the NFL should be very afraid. Tom Brady would Josh Gordon for 16 games. And by the way, it's already looked amazing. Tom Brady looked amazing this week by the way. Like I'm just imagining imagining Tom Brady into those joint practices with a really good team. But with Josh Gordon said instead of gunnard, you could be Myers, but it's",

So let's discuss some powerful techniques for mess of growth. First of all, this is honest. I hope you're taking notes for not taking notes. What even are you doing? Take notes get out of pain pull over on the side of the road. Do what you got to do. Let's roll. First of all, you've got to make a decision you have to decide here. Now I am going to become recruiting Superstar. Everything has to start with a decision. You have to make the decision you're going to master this you have to make the decision. You're not going to give up and I'll tell you there are some of you thousands of you listening to this and you are going to give up but for those of you who aren't gonna give up. I'm talking to you make the decision to master recruiting and not give up. Make up your mind to learn make up your mind to develop skills. Make up your mind to understand that this takes time. Excuse me. I was in Vegas. My lungs are all jacked up. Make up your mind to pass your fear of talking to people and come out of your shell. Like I'm telling you. Yes, it's scary. But you're doing a massive disservice to the world to yourself to your family by not talking to people I guarantee there are people right here listening to this podcast right this second who you need this and you know moms were sitting on the park bench at the park that are frustrated and they needed and they need an extra income, you know business owners whose businesses are actually going on. This they need you. So make up your mind to get past your fears of talking to people and get out of your shell your decision to have a better life should be more significant than your fears and insecurities around recruiting and even if you're an introvert, make up your mind to make it a priority and do it whenever you choose introversion is not Annex is not a reason. It's an excuse right? Like for those of you who don't know. I am not the extroverted person. You think I am I am introverted. I like to stare at a wall. I just did an event on Saturday. It took me until about 4 p.m. Sunday to even leave the hotel room to get food. I was so high. Okay, so make up your mind. Your introversion is not an excuse. There are plenty of books on Charisma get a personality. Okay. I love you guys saying it out of love. So tip number one make a decision. My next tip is you need to develop a recruiting mindset. So if you're in an MLM and you're listening to this that means to me that something drew you to the network marketing profession. Okay. It could have been the product your company sells. All's it could have been the compensation plan. It could have been friendships. It could have been the ability to work with awesome people. It could have been the personal development whatever. Okay, it is enough motivation. I'm telling you whatever the reason was. Just to develop a network marketing recruiting mindset. Okay, you need to understand you're no longer an employee. It is not your fault or it is not your up one's fault. If you're not successful it is your fault. Okay, it is your fault. If you're not as successful as you want just like if you make a million dollars, the last thing you want your upline to do is go oooooh develop that person know you have to develop an entrepreneurial mindset. You have to be ready to approach me with your opportunity without fear and you have to decide not to be apologetic about it. You need to be brave, you know, you're trying to share a great gift with somebody you need to know that you need to know that there's more to this life than struggling then not being able to put your kids in the school's you want to put them in to not be able to have the clothes. You want the car. You want the house you want the life you want? Okay. So share your gift. If you ever want to be an entrepreneur a series on turn or not. I want to burn or I'm going and you want to work from home, you know in your heart of hearts that never marketing is an excellent way to start because you can listen to all the business podcast in the world, okay? These people are having to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to start things up. That's crazy. That's not network marketing. It's not so I need you to basically realize that network marketing. Yes, it is selling and yes, it is recruiting. But yes, it is selling your products. And yes, it is selling yourself really but it also involves prospecting. It also involves recruiting it also involves training it also occur. Involves follow-ups, it also involves accounting and so much more event planning whatever else you can make it a a career that pays you full-time money. If you develop that mindset that's required to invest your time and energy into it. Okay. All right. I need to get some of my protein",

I am just hanging out at home. Yeah. I am too. Oh you were at home. We're not in the studio together. Nope. Today is a rainy phone day. It's yeah, it says it pouring by you. It was the last couple days bad enough where they actually have to shut down to streets. Oh my God, because there's a little divot there. Oh and it flooded and it is a massive friggin flood. Well so that I had to take another route to take my son to school. Oh, wow. Yeah. So anyway here we are eight episodes in we have a great show here today. We're going to be talking about Our top five tours top five venues or just top tours and top venues, whatever we want to talk about. Yeah. So I mean I have done many many tours. It would be hard really to pick a top five because I've had more than five amazing tours. And and venues have been so many that we have done that have come and gone. But you guys also do a lot of you know, you know your venues that you've played and you know, the venues that are going to be amazing. So when you guys go back to places like revolution in Florida or machine shop or you know, those are going to be sick Nonpoint shows. So those have to be in your top five. I mean the the Revolution being your home base, you know in a way I do have a top five but I may do like some bonus venues sure because it's a little hard to pick but my my number one venue will always be revolution in Fort Lauderdale. I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too. Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to. Be promoted to you know, and that was just I mean you've been there you've recorded shows there. We've done the Alive and Kicking DVD there we did the red pill their 20th anniversary. Yeah, we did a couple other things there and it's just one of the venues that I just hope it stays around forever. It's been Pretty consistent. I was hoping that there were not be another name change or it would close down and so far. It's been killer and we're hoping to get back there in the fall to do another show with Mitch. Mr. Rocha may come down and record. Yeah, I'm always down to go to Florida as long as it's in cold weather in Chicago. I'll go wherever you guys are playing where it's warm, of course, and yeah, I mean revolution has been host to many many shows and they they have many different. Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats. Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo. That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know. It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir. And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show. That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there. So a lot of musicians went up there, too. Work out. There's a gym right next to the Danny's. There was a White Castle and awesome sushi place. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there that I mean, I don't personally like White Castle, but I know a lot of people that do ya and there was a great situation and was run by Frank. Yeah from FN from FM. I mean, he booked so many amazing shows. We played to a Sevendust we played there with",

I mean the the Revolution being your home base, you know in a way I do have a top five but I may do like some bonus venues sure because it's a little hard to pick but my my number one venue will always be revolution in Fort Lauderdale. I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too. Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to. Be promoted to you know, and that was just I mean you've been there you've recorded shows there. We've done the Alive and Kicking DVD there we did the red pill their 20th anniversary. Yeah, we did a couple other things there and it's just one of the venues that I just hope it stays around forever. It's been Pretty consistent. I was hoping that there were not be another name change or it would close down and so far. It's been killer and we're hoping to get back there in the fall to do another show with Mitch. Mr. Rocha may come down and record. Yeah, I'm always down to go to Florida as long as it's in cold weather in Chicago. I'll go wherever you guys are playing where it's warm, of course, and yeah, I mean revolution has been host to many many shows and they they have many different. Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats. Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo. That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know. It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir. And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show. That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there. So a lot of musicians went up there, too. Work out. There's a gym right next to the Danny's. There was a White Castle and awesome sushi place. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there that I mean, I don't personally like White Castle, but I know a lot of people that do ya and there was a great situation and was run by Frank. Yeah from FN from FM. I mean, he booked so many amazing shows. We played to a Sevendust we played there with",

I am just hanging out at home. Yeah. I am too. Oh you were at home. We're not in the studio together. Nope. Today is a rainy phone day. It's yeah, it says it pouring by you. It was the last couple days bad enough where they actually have to shut down to streets. Oh my God, because there's a little divot there. Oh and it flooded and it is a massive friggin flood. Well so that I had to take another route to take my son to school. Oh, wow. Yeah. So anyway here we are eight episodes in we have a great show here today. We're going to be talking about Our top five tours top five venues or just top tours and top venues, whatever we want to talk about. Yeah. So I mean I have done many many tours. It would be hard really to pick a top five because I've had more than five amazing tours. And and venues have been so many that we have done that have come and gone. But you guys also do a lot of you know, you know your venues that you've played and you know, the venues that are going to be amazing. So when you guys go back to places like revolution in Florida or machine shop or you know, those are going to be sick Nonpoint shows. So those have to be in your top five. I mean the the Revolution being your home base, you know in a way I do have a top five but I may do like some bonus venues sure because it's a little hard to pick but my my number one venue will always be revolution in Fort Lauderdale. I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too. Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to. Be promoted to you know, and that was just I mean you've been there you've recorded shows there. We've done the Alive and Kicking DVD there we did the red pill their 20th anniversary. Yeah, we did a couple other things there and it's just one of the venues that I just hope it stays around forever. It's been Pretty consistent. I was hoping that there were not be another name change or it would close down and so far. It's been killer and we're hoping to get back there in the fall to do another show with Mitch. Mr. Rocha may come down and record. Yeah, I'm always down to go to Florida as long as it's in cold weather in Chicago. I'll go wherever you guys are playing where it's warm, of course, and yeah, I mean revolution has been host to many many shows and they they have many different. Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats. Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo. That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know. It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir. And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show. That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there. So a lot of musicians went up there, too. Work out. There's a gym right next to the Danny's. There was a White Castle and awesome sushi place. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there that I mean, I don't personally like White Castle, but I know a lot of people that do ya and there was a great situation and was run by Frank. Yeah from FN from FM. I mean, he booked so many amazing shows. We played to a Sevendust we played there with",

I am just hanging out at home. Yeah. I am too. Oh you were at home. We're not in the studio together. Nope. Today is a rainy phone day. It's yeah, it says it pouring by you. It was the last couple days bad enough where they actually have to shut down to streets. Oh my God, because there's a little divot there. Oh and it flooded and it is a massive friggin flood. Well so that I had to take another route to take my son to school. Oh, wow. Yeah. So anyway here we are eight episodes in we have a great show here today. We're going to be talking about Our top five tours top five venues or just top tours and top venues, whatever we want to talk about. Yeah. So I mean I have done many many tours. It would be hard really to pick a top five because I've had more than five amazing tours. And and venues have been so many that we have done that have come and gone. But you guys also do a lot of you know, you know your venues that you've played and you know, the venues that are going to be amazing. So when you guys go back to places like revolution in Florida or machine shop or you know, those are going to be sick Nonpoint shows. So those have to be in your top five. I mean the the Revolution being your home base, you know in a way I do have a top five but I may do like some bonus venues sure because it's a little hard to pick but my my number one venue will always be revolution in Fort Lauderdale. I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too. Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to. Be promoted to you know, and that was just I mean you've been there you've recorded shows there. We've done the Alive and Kicking DVD there we did the red pill their 20th anniversary. Yeah, we did a couple other things there and it's just one of the venues that I just hope it stays around forever. It's been Pretty consistent. I was hoping that there were not be another name change or it would close down and so far. It's been killer and we're hoping to get back there in the fall to do another show with Mitch. Mr. Rocha may come down and record. Yeah, I'm always down to go to Florida as long as it's in cold weather in Chicago. I'll go wherever you guys are playing where it's warm, of course, and yeah, I mean revolution has been host to many many shows and they they have many different. Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats. Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo. That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know. It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir. And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show. That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there. So a lot of musicians went up there, too. Work out. There's a gym right next to the Danny's. There was a White Castle and awesome sushi place. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there that I mean, I don't personally like White Castle, but I know a lot of people that do ya and there was a great situation and was run by Frank. Yeah from FN from FM. I mean, he booked so many amazing shows. We played to a Sevendust we played there with",

I am just hanging out at home. Yeah. I am too. Oh you were at home. We're not in the studio together. Nope. Today is a rainy phone day. It's yeah, it says it pouring by you. It was the last couple days bad enough where they actually have to shut down to streets. Oh my God, because there's a little divot there. Oh and it flooded and it is a massive friggin flood. Well so that I had to take another route to take my son to school. Oh, wow. Yeah. So anyway here we are eight episodes in we have a great show here today. We're going to be talking about Our top five tours top five venues or just top tours and top venues, whatever we want to talk about. Yeah. So I mean I have done many many tours. It would be hard really to pick a top five because I've had more than five amazing tours. And and venues have been so many that we have done that have come and gone. But you guys also do a lot of you know, you know your venues that you've played and you know, the venues that are going to be amazing. So when you guys go back to places like revolution in Florida or machine shop or you know, those are going to be sick Nonpoint shows. So those have to be in your top five. I mean the the Revolution being your home base, you know in a way I do have a top five but I may do like some bonus venues sure because it's a little hard to pick but my my number one venue will always be revolution in Fort Lauderdale. I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too. Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to. Be promoted to you know, and that was just I mean you've been there you've recorded shows there. We've done the Alive and Kicking DVD there we did the red pill their 20th anniversary. Yeah, we did a couple other things there and it's just one of the venues that I just hope it stays around forever. It's been Pretty consistent. I was hoping that there were not be another name change or it would close down and so far. It's been killer and we're hoping to get back there in the fall to do another show with Mitch. Mr. Rocha may come down and record. Yeah, I'm always down to go to Florida as long as it's in cold weather in Chicago. I'll go wherever you guys are playing where it's warm, of course, and yeah, I mean revolution has been host to many many shows and they they have many different. Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats. Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo. That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know. It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir. And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show. That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there.

I am just hanging out at home. Yeah. I am too. Oh you were at home. We're not in the studio together. Nope. Today is a rainy phone day. It's yeah, it says it pouring by you. It was the last couple days bad enough where they actually have to shut down to streets. Oh my God, because there's a little divot there. Oh and it flooded and it is a massive friggin flood. Well so that I had to take another route to take my son to school. Oh, wow. Yeah. So anyway here we are eight episodes in we have a great show here today. We're going to be talking about Our top five tours top five venues or just top tours and top venues, whatever we want to talk about. Yeah. So I mean I have done many many tours. It would be hard really to pick a top five because I've had more than five amazing tours. And and venues have been so many that we have done that have come and gone. But you guys also do a lot of you know, you know your venues that you've played and you know, the venues that are going to be amazing. So when you guys go back to places like revolution in Florida or machine shop or you know, those are going to be sick Nonpoint shows. So those have to be in your top five. I mean the the Revolution being your home base, you know in a way I do have a top five but I may do like some bonus venues sure because it's a little hard to pick but my my number one venue will always be revolution in Fort Lauderdale. I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too. Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to. Be promoted to you know, and that was just I mean you've been there you've recorded shows there. We've done the Alive and Kicking DVD there we did the red pill their 20th anniversary. Yeah, we did a couple other things there and it's just one of the venues that I just hope it stays around forever. It's been Pretty consistent. I was hoping that there were not be another name change or it would close down and so far. It's been killer and we're hoping to get back there in the fall to do another show with Mitch. Mr. Rocha may come down and record. Yeah, I'm always down to go to Florida as long as it's in cold weather in Chicago. I'll go wherever you guys are playing where it's warm, of course, and yeah, I mean revolution has been host to many many shows and they they have many different. Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats. Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo.

It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo. That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know. It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir. And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show. That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there. So a lot of musicians went up there, too. Work out. There's a gym right next to the Danny's. There was a White Castle and awesome sushi place. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there that I mean, I don't personally like White Castle, but I know a lot of people that do ya and there was a great situation and was run by Frank. Yeah from FN from FM. I mean, he booked so many amazing shows. We played to a Sevendust we played there with",

I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too. Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to.

Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats. Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo. That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know. It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir. And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show. That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there. So a lot of musicians went up there, too. Work out. There's a gym right next to the Danny's. There was a White Castle and awesome sushi place. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there that I mean, I don't personally like White Castle, but I know a lot of people that do ya and there was a great situation and was run by Frank. Yeah from FN from FM. I mean, he booked so many amazing shows. We played to a Sevendust we played there with",
