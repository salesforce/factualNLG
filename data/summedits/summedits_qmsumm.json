Um  Oh ,\nProject Manager: this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign .  We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um  but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went .

Um\nUser Interface: But that's that's only for the buttons .\nProject Manager: I I guess if we leave the  if we leave this one out , um\nUser Interface: So the button we can use plastic .\nProject Manager: oh .\nProject Manager: And uh maybe not use the special form .\nUser Interface: And the pla uh  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: But it\nProject Manager: It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: But it's the board decision . Um  And um  yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , b basically it   when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an  uh focus on another uh\nIndustrial Designer: So  Type of m maybe another market segment .\nProject Manager: Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: and uh m maximise the profits\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: and um\nIndustrial Designer: That's  maybe that's better .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Maybe we could uh  we should go for straight and simple ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but that's not what uh has been asked .\nProject Manager: I know , I know .\nIndustrial Designer: So we should kick the board's uh   Well\nProject Manager: Yeah . Although I think we  yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nProject Manager: Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .\nIndustrial Designer: Yes .\nProject Manager: Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no .  It's not that innovative .\nProject Manager: Or however you s pronounce that .\nUser Interface: Yeah , too bad .\nProject Manager: Um so , okay .  Um  Oh ,\nProject Manager: this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign .  We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um  but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess\nMarketing: Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , that's true .\nIndustrial Designer: Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .\nProject Manager: We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .\nIndustrial Designer: So",

Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this\nMarketing: And I can start if you want . Mm .\nProject Manager: sure .\nMarketing: Is there an order ? No .\nProject Manager: Hm ?\nMarketing: We haven't decided on an order .\nProject Manager: No , any any order's fine . Yeah .\nMarketing: First . Okay . Um , how do I put this\nIndustrial Designer: Just uh\nMarketing: I'll just put the cable in .\nProject Manager: Oh yeah , sorry .\nMarketing: Is that it ? Can you see ?  Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ?\nProject Manager: It sh it takes a few seconds I think .\nIndustrial Designer: You may need to\nUser Interface: Who's that ?\nMarketing: No .\nIndustrial Designer: But sometimes you have to do it\nMarketing: Is it in the right thing ?\nIndustrial Designer: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .\nMarketing: Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh , and then press function .\nProject Manager: and F_ eight .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Could you just plug it back into hers because she had\nMarketing: Oh , wait .\nUser Interface: oh .\nMarketing: That's  is that it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Adjusting .\nProject Manager: Here we are .\nIndustrial Designer: The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it .\nMarketing: Right here we are .\nProject Manager: Oh . Is it on ?\nMarketing: We're here .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .\nProject Manager: Hm .\nMarketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than  you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .  And that's all I have to say about the matter ,  um .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Shall I  what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?\nProject Manager: Yeah . Just move right on .\nUser Interface: Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?\nProject Manager: Uh function F_ eight .\nMarketing: Function F_ eight .\nUser Interface: 'Kay . What's function ?\nProject Manager: It's the little blue  w it's the one  th\nUser Interface: Oh function , I see it .\nProject Manager: yeah . Yeah should be\nUser Interface: There we go .",

Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons .

Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .\nProject Manager: Hm .\nMarketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than  you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .  And that's all I have to say about the matter ,  um .\nProject Manager: 'Kay .\nMarketing: Shall I  what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .

It 's  it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions , and in colored noise .\nProfessor C: I see . So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a\nPhD A: Wiener filtering . It 's a  it 's a cascade of two s\nProfessor C: Wiener filter . Yeah , in general , you don't  that 's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy . Actually .

OK . Yeah . So .\nProfessor C: Uh , so .\nPhD A: So that  that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some  something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further .\nPhD D: What was your point about  about colored noise there ?\nPhD A: Oh , the colored noise uh\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: the colored noise  the  the v the signal subspace approach has  I mean , it  it actually depends on inverting the matrices . So it  it  ac the covariance matrix of the noise . So if  if it is not positive definite ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I mean it has a  it 's  It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite .\nProfessor C: So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise .\nPhD A: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , first of the colo colored noise\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then make the noise white ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .\nPhD D: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: I was only half kidding . I mean if you  sort of  you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and then you  then  then add a little bit l noise  noise addition  I mean , that sort of what J  JRASTA does , in a way .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little  adding a little noise ,\nPhD A: Huh ?

So ,\nProfessor C: Right , so he 's doing a signal subspace thing , maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction , or maybe vi maybe the other way around ,\nPhD D: Yeah , mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: you know ?\nPhD A: So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I mean just to see all  some  some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .

It 's  it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions , and in colored noise .\nProfessor C: I see .

OK . Yeah . So .\nProfessor C: Uh , so .\nPhD A: So that  that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some  something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further .\nPhD D: What was your point about  about colored noise there ?\nPhD A: Oh , the colored noise uh\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: the colored noise  the  the v the signal subspace approach has  I mean , it  it actually depends on inverting the matrices . So it  it  ac the covariance matrix of the noise . So if  if it is not positive definite ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I mean it has a  it 's  It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite .\nProfessor C: So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise .\nPhD A: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , first of the colo colored noise\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then make the noise white ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .\nPhD D: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: I was only half kidding . I mean if you  sort of  you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and then you  then  then add a little bit l noise  noise addition  I mean , that sort of what J  JRASTA does , in a way .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little  adding a little noise ,\nPhD A: Huh ?

Well , it 's both  both uh , cases can i\nPhD F: Oh .\nPhD D: Yeah . So - some of the proposal , uh , we 're doing this on the bin  on the FFT bins ,\nPhD F: Hmm .\nPhD D: others on the um , mel energies . You can do both , but I cannot tell you what 's  which one might be better or  I\nPhD F: Hmm .\nPhD A: I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins .\nPhD D: I don't know . Yeah , but\nPhD F: Mmm .\nPhD A: But for speech recognition , it may not . I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT . So you 're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that .\nPhD F: I see .\nPhD A: Well  Yeah ?\nPhD F: Hmm .\nPhD A: So , it may not be really a big different .\nPhD D: Well , it gives something different , but I don't know what are the , pros and cons of both .\nPhD A: It I Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: Hmm .\nPhD A: So\nProfessor C: OK .\nPhD A: The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique , uh , is it like one stage speech enhancement ? Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals , which is really giving them some improvement .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I mean they just do the same thing again once more .\nProfessor C: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: And  So , there 's something that is good about doing it  I mean , to cleaning it up once more .\nPhD D: Yeah , it might be .\nPhD A: Yeah ,\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: so we can\nPhD D: So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing\nPhD A: Yeah . That 's what\nProfessor C: Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing .\nPhD D: and  Yeah .\nProfessor C: I mean maybe one or  one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first .\nPhD A: That 's wh Yeah . So ,\nProfessor C: Right , so he 's doing a signal subspace thing , maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction , or maybe vi maybe the other way around ,\nPhD D: Yeah , mm - hmm .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: you know ?\nPhD A: So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I mean just to see all  some  some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not .\nPhD D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah .\nProfessor C: How is it  I  I guess I 'm ignorant about this , how does  I mean , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're  that you 're adding together the two signals , how is  how is that differ from signal subspace ?\nPhD A: The signal subspace ? The\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: The signal subspace approach has actually an in - built Wiener filtering in it .\nProfessor C: Oh , OK .\nPhD A: Yeah . It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter . Is the signal is  is a signal substrate .\nProfessor C: Oh , oh , OK so the difference is the KL .\nPhD A: So , the  the different  the c the  the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad . It 's  it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions , and in colored noise .\nProfessor C: I see . So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a\nPhD A: Wiener filtering . It 's a  it 's a cascade of two s\nProfessor C: Wiener filter . Yeah , in general , you don't  that 's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy . Actually . Um , that was something that uh , Herve and I were talking about with um , the multi - band stuff , that if you 're converting things to from uh , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy .\nPhD A: Mm - hmm . OK . Yeah . So .\nProfessor C: Uh , so .\nPhD A: So that  that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some  something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further .\nPhD D: What was your point about  about colored noise there ?\nPhD A: Oh , the colored noise uh\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: the colored noise  the  the v the signal subspace approach has  I mean , it  it actually depends on inverting the matrices . So it  it  ac the covariance matrix of the noise . So if  if it is not positive definite ,\nPhD D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD A: I mean it has a  it 's  It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite .\nProfessor C: So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise .\nPhD A: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , first of the colo colored noise\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then make the noise white ,\nProfessor C: Yeah .\nPhD A: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .\nPhD D: Yeah , right .\nProfessor C: I was only half kidding . I mean if you  sort of  you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid\nPhD A: Yeah .\nPhD D: Yeah .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: and then you  then  then add a little bit l noise  noise addition  I mean , that sort of what J  JRASTA does , in a way .\nPhD A: Yeah .\nProfessor C: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little  adding a little noise ,\nPhD A: Huh ? Uh - huh .\nPhD D: Uh - huh .\nProfessor C: in order to get rid of the effects of noise .\nPhD A: So .\nProfessor C: OK .\nPhD D: Yeah . Uh , yeah . So there is this . And maybe we  well we find some people so that  uh , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of VTS techniques so it 's um , Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm ,  uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra .

So what makes things more likely that\nProfessor B: Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse .\nGrad E: So\nProfessor B: So Keith this is gonna get into your world because uh we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties\nGrad A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: s and so I  I don't yet know how to do this , I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: So that  that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for\nGrad E: We  we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint .\nProfessor B: Of  of course .\nGrad E: Identified that\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad E: and so again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we don't have the discourse model here yet . Much the same way as we didn't  we don't have the ontology here .\nProfessor B: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth .\nGrad E: Really .\nProfessor B: So in some sense it 's  it 's there .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet .\nGrad E: Yeah . Um This be specific for second year ? Um And  and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint .\nProfessor B: But if we do it 'll have the three values .\nGrad E: Hmm ?\nProfessor B: It 'll have the EVA values if  if we have it .\nGrad E: Yeah . Yeah . OK just for starters and here discourse um\nProfessor B: For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . That 's what we talked about .\nGrad E: um well , I think um we 're looking at the  the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: So this should sort of push it in one direction\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad E: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And sometimes um people say where is it\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably\nProfessor B: Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're  you want these two values .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , true . So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either  yep , yay , A , or nay . Yeah . OK ?\nProfessor B: And they 'll be a y uh , a user Go - there and maybe that 's all , I don't know .\nGrad D: Situation Go - there , I mean , because it 's  whether it 's open or not .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK , good .\nGrad D: That definitely interes\nProfessor B: Yep .\nGrad D: But that now that kind of um what 's the word\nGrad A: Hmm .\nGrad D: um the  that interacts with the uh EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it 's fine to go there when it 's closed whereas if they want to um\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad D: so\nProfessor B: Right , so that 's  that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting , so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: in terms of uh uh you know , whether  whether you wanna go there .\nGrad D: The time of day ,\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: right I  well , right .\nGrad C: It does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something .\nProfessor B: Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter .\nGrad D: Right . So yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this  that node by itself wouldn't distinguish\nProfessor B: Well i i it can have di various values . Yeah , but we eh you  you 're right it might not be enough .\nGrad D: Yeah , I mean , see I 'm  I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false .\nGrad A: Well , what  Whoops .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor B: Ah . I see that could be .\nGrad A: Also , that node , I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the\nProfessor B: Could be . Yeah . N\nGrad D: Like situation traffic and so on .\nGrad A: Yeah , the time of day .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . So  so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision\nGrad D: I guess the final\nProfessor B: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node . And I  don't worry about layout ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean then we 'll go  we 'll go nuts but\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into ?\nProfessor B: Could be , yeah .\nGrad D: Right . Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed  feed into the Go - there S That 's right ,\nGrad D: Yeah , right .\nProfessor B: so the Endpoint node ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: make that up t t to the Go - there then\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that . Now it 's gonna be important not to have loops by the way . Uh really important in  in the belief worl net world not to have loops\nGrad E: I was just gonna\nProfessor B: uh\nGrad D: Yes .\nGrad E: How long does it take you to  to compute uh\nProfessor B: No it 's much worse than that . It  if i loo it  it  it  it  it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops ,\nGrad D: It  things don't converge , yeah .\nGrad E: uh R recursive action ?\nProfessor B: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't uh OK .\nGrad E: Uh but this isn't , this is  this line is just coming from over here .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we  we , in no , in\nGrad D: Yeah .

That 's what we talked about .\nGrad E: um well , I think um we 're looking at the  the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: So this should sort of push it in one direction\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad E: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And sometimes um people say where is it\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably\nProfessor B: Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're  you want these two values .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , true . So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either  yep , yay , A , or nay . Yeah .

So yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this  that node by itself wouldn't distinguish\nProfessor B: Well i i it can have di various values . Yeah , but we eh you  you 're right it might not be enough .\nGrad D: Yeah , I mean , see I 'm  I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false .\nGrad A: Well , what  Whoops .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor B: Ah .

Yeah , but we eh you  you 're right it might not be enough .\nGrad D: Yeah , I mean , see I 'm  I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false .\nGrad A: Well , what  Whoops .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor B: Ah . I see that could be .\nGrad A: Also , that node , I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the\nProfessor B: Could be . Yeah . N\nGrad D: Like situation traffic and so on .\nGrad A: Yeah , the time of day .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . So  so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision\nGrad D: I guess the final\nProfessor B: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node .

Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed  feed into the Go - there S That 's right ,\nGrad D: Yeah , right .\nProfessor B: so the Endpoint node ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: make that up t t to the Go - there then\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that .

Much the same way as we didn't  we don't have the ontology here .\nProfessor B: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth .\nGrad E: Really .\nProfessor B: So in some sense it 's  it 's there .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet .\nGrad E: Yeah . Um This be specific for second year ? Um And  and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint .\nProfessor B: But if we do it 'll have the three values .\nGrad E: Hmm ?\nProfessor B: It 'll have the EVA values if  if we have it .\nGrad E: Yeah . Yeah . OK just for starters and here discourse um\nProfessor B: For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . That 's what we talked about .\nGrad E: um well , I think um we 're looking at the  the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: So this should sort of push it in one direction\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad E: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And sometimes um people say where is it\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably\nProfessor B: Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're  you want these two values .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , true . So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either  yep , yay , A , or nay . Yeah . OK ?\nProfessor B: And they 'll be a y uh , a user Go - there and maybe that 's all , I don't know .\nGrad D: Situation Go - there , I mean , because it 's  whether it 's open or not .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: OK , good .\nGrad D: That definitely interes\nProfessor B: Yep .\nGrad D: But that now that kind of um what 's the word\nGrad A: Hmm .\nGrad D: um the  that interacts with the uh EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it 's fine to go there when it 's closed whereas if they want to um\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad D: so\nProfessor B: Right , so that 's  that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting , so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: in terms of uh uh you know , whether  whether you wanna go there .\nGrad D: The time of day ,\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: right I  well , right .\nGrad C: It does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something .\nProfessor B: Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter .\nGrad D: Right . So yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this  that node by itself wouldn't distinguish\nProfessor B: Well i i it can have di various values . Yeah , but we eh you  you 're right it might not be enough .\nGrad D: Yeah , I mean , see I 'm  I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false .\nGrad A: Well , what  Whoops .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor B: Ah . I see that could be .\nGrad A: Also , that node , I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the\nProfessor B: Could be . Yeah . N\nGrad D: Like situation traffic and so on .\nGrad A: Yeah , the time of day .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . So  so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision\nGrad D: I guess the final\nProfessor B: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node . And I  don't worry about layout ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean then we 'll go  we 'll go nuts but\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into ?\nProfessor B: Could be , yeah .\nGrad D: Right . Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed  feed into the Go - there S That 's right ,\nGrad D: Yeah , right .\nProfessor B: so the Endpoint node ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: make that up t t to the Go - there then\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that . Now it 's gonna be important not to have loops by the way . Uh really important in  in the belief worl net world not to have loops\nGrad E: I was just gonna\nProfessor B: uh\nGrad D: Yes .\nGrad E: How long does it take you to  to compute uh\nProfessor B: No it 's much worse than that . It  if i loo it  it  it  it  it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops ,\nGrad D: It  things don't converge , yeah .\nGrad E: uh R recursive action ?\nProfessor B: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't uh OK .\nGrad E: Uh but this isn't , this is  this line is just coming from over here .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we  we , in no , in\nGrad D: Yeah .

Yeah , but we eh you  you 're right it might not be enough .\nGrad D: Yeah , I mean , see I 'm  I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false .\nGrad A: Well , what  Whoops .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor B: Ah . I see that could be .\nGrad A: Also , that node , I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the\nProfessor B: Could be . Yeah . N\nGrad D: Like situation traffic and so on .\nGrad A: Yeah , the time of day .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . So  so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision\nGrad D: I guess the final\nProfessor B: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node .

Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed  feed into the Go - there S That 's right ,\nGrad D: Yeah , right .\nProfessor B: so the Endpoint node ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: make that up t t to the Go - there then\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that .

That 's what we talked about .\nGrad E: um well , I think um we 're looking at the  the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there .\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: So this should sort of push it in one direction\nProfessor B: Right .\nGrad E: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there .\nProfessor B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And sometimes um people say where is it\nGrad A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably\nProfessor B: Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're  you want these two values .\nGrad E: Oh yeah , true . So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either  yep , yay , A , or nay . Yeah .

So yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this  that node by itself wouldn't distinguish\nProfessor B: Well i i it can have di various values . Yeah , but we eh you  you 're right it might not be enough .\nGrad D: Yeah , I mean , see I 'm  I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false .\nGrad A: Well , what  Whoops .\nProfessor B: Yeah .\nGrad A: Right .\nProfessor B: Ah . I see that could be .\nGrad A: Also , that node , I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad A: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the\nProfessor B: Could be . Yeah . N\nGrad D: Like situation traffic and so on .\nGrad A: Yeah , the time of day .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Yeah . So  so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision\nGrad D: I guess the final\nProfessor B: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node . And I  don't worry about layout ,\nGrad D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: I mean then we 'll go  we 'll go nuts but\nGrad D: Mmm .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into ?\nProfessor B: Could be , yeah .\nGrad D: Right . Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up .\nProfessor B: Yeah . Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed  feed into the Go - there S That 's right ,\nGrad D: Yeah , right .\nProfessor B: so the Endpoint node ,\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor B: make that up t t to the Go - there then\nGrad E: Yeah .\nProfessor B: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that . Now it 's gonna be important not to have loops by the way . Uh really important in  in the belief worl net world not to have loops\nGrad E: I was just gonna\nProfessor B: uh\nGrad D: Yes .\nGrad E: How long does it take you to  to compute uh\nProfessor B: No it 's much worse than that . It  if i loo it  it  it  it  it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops ,\nGrad D: It  things don't converge , yeah .\nGrad E: uh R recursive action ?\nProfessor B: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't uh OK .\nGrad E: Uh but this isn't , this is  this line is just coming from over here .\nGrad D: Yeah .\nProfessor B: Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we  we , in no , in\nGrad D: Yeah .
