Below, you are given a edited text document, in which the edits have been marked in XML form (e.g., <ins>inserted text</ins> or <del>deleted text</del>).
Your task is to select the types of edits that have been applied to the document overall. You can select several of the four types, but at least one is relevant:
- `entity_modification`: is when a named entity or phrase has been modified to change the meaning of the document. For instance changing `15 minutes` to `20 minutes` or `New York` to `New Jersey`.
- `antonym_swap`: is when a word has been replaced with its antonym or other similar word that alters the document's meaning. For instance changing `good` to `bad` or `increase` to `flatten`.
- `hallucinated_fact_insertion`: when a new fact has been inserted into the document, and there's a chance it was not supported in the original document. For instance adding that a protagonist `does not like to talk with strangers`.
- `negation_insertion_removal`: when a negation has been inserted or removed from the document. For instance changing `I like to eat apples` to `I do not like to eat apples`.
First, we give you one example of each type of edit:
